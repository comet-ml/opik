## Project set up and Architecture

The Opik project is made up of five main sub-projects:

* `apps/opik-documentation`: The Opik documentation website
* `deployment/installer`: The Opik installer
* `sdks/python`: The Opik Python SDK
* `apps/opik-frontend`: The Opik frontend application
* `apps/opik-backend`: The Opik backend server


In addition, Opik relies on:

1. Clickhouse: Used to trace traces, spans and feedback scores
2. MySQL: Used to store metadata associated with projects, datasets, experiments, etc.
3. Redis: Used for caching

#### Setting up the environment

The local development environment is based on `docker-compose`. 
Please see instructions in `deployment/docker-compose/README.md`

### Contributing to the documentation

The documentation is made up of three main parts:

1. `apps/opik-documentation/documentation`: The Opik documentation website
2. `apps/opik-documentation/python-sdk-docs`: The Python reference documentation
3. `apps/opik-documentation/rest-api-docs`: The REST API reference documentation

#### Contributing to the documentation website

The documentation website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and is located in `apps/opik-documentation/documentation`.

In order to run the documentation website locally, you need to have `npm` installed. Once installed, you can run the documentation locally using the following command:

```bash
cd apps/opik-documentation/documentation

# Install dependencies - Only needs to be run once
npm install

# Run the documentation website locally
npm run dev
```

You can then access the documentation website at `http://localhost:3000`. Any change you make to the documentation will be updated in real-time.

#### Contributing to the Python SDK reference documentation

The Python SDK reference documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and is located in `apps/opik-documentation/python-sdk-docs`.

In order to run the Python SDK reference documentation locally, you need to have `python` and `pip` installed. Once installed, you can run the documentation locally using the following command:

```bash
cd apps/opik-documentation/python-sdk-docs

# Install dependencies - Only needs to be run once
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the python sdk reference documentation locally
make dev
```

The Python SDK reference documentation will be built and available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Any change you make to the documentation will be updated in real-time.

### Contributing to the Python SDK

**Setting up your development environment:**

In order to develop features in the Python SDK, you will need to have Opik running locally. You can follow the instructions in the [Configuring your development environment](#configuring-your-development-environment) section or by running Opik locally with Docker Compose:

```bash
cd deployment/docker-compose

# Starting the Opik platform
docker compose up --detach

# Configure the Python SDK to point to the local Opik deployment
opik configure --use_local
```

The Opik server will be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

**Submitting a PR:**

First, please read the [coding guidelines](sdks/python/README.md) for our Python SDK

The Python SDK is available under `sdks/python` and can be installed locally using `pip install -e sdks/python`.

Before submitting a PR, please ensure that your code passes the test suite:

```bash
cd sdks/python

pytest tests/
```

and the linter:

```bash
cd sdks/python

pre-commit run --all-files
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you changes impact public facing methods or docstrings, please also update the documentation. You can find more information about updating the docs in the [documentation contribution guide](#contributing-to-the-documentation).

### Contributing to the frontend

The Opik frontend is a React application that is located in `apps/opik-frontend`.

In order to run the frontend locally, you need to have `npm` installed. Once installed, you can run the frontend locally using the following command:

```bash
# Run the backend locally with the flag "--local-fe"
./build_and_run.sh --local-fe

cd apps/opik-frontend

# Install dependencies - Only needs to be run once
npm install

# Run the frontend locally
npm run start
```

You can then access the development frontend at `http://localhost:5173/`. Any change you make to the frontend will be updated in real-time.

> You will need to open the FE using `http://localhost:5173/` ignoring the output from the `npm run start` command which will recommend to open `http://localhost:5174/`. In case `http://localhost:5174/` is opened, the BE will not be accessible.

Before submitting a PR, please ensure that your code passes the test suite, the linter and the type checker:

```bash
cd apps/opik-frontend

npm run e2e
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

### Contributing to the backend

In order to run the external services (Clickhouse, MySQL, Redis), you can use the `build_and_run.sh` script or `docker-compose`:

```bash
cd deployment/docker-compose

docker compose up clickhouse redis mysql -d
```

#### Running the backend

The Opik backend is a Java application that is located in `apps/opik-backend`.

In order to run the backend locally, you need to have `java` and `maven` installed. Once installed, you can run the backend locally using the following command:

```bash
cd apps/opik-backend

# Build the Opik application
mvn clean install

# Start the Opik application
java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar server config.yml
```
Replace `{project.pom.version}` with the version of the project in the pom file.

Once the backend is running, you can access the Opik API at `http://localhost:8080`.

#### Formatting the code

Before submitting a PR, please ensure that your code is formatted correctly.
Run the following command to automatically format your code:

```bash
mvn spotless:apply
```

Our CI will check that the code is formatted correctly and will fail if it is not by running the following command:

```bash
mvn spotless:check
```

#### Testing the backend

Before submitting a PR, please ensure that your code passes the test suite:

```bash
cd apps/opik-backend

mvn test
```

Tests leverage the `testcontainers` library to run integration tests against a real instances of the external services. Ports are randomly assigned by the library to avoid conflicts.

#### Advanced usage

*Health Check*
To see your applications health enter url `http://localhost:8080/healthcheck`

**Run migrations**

*DDL migrations*

The project handles it using [liquibase](https://www.liquibase.com/). Such migrations are located at `apps/opik-backend/src/main/resources/liquibase/{{DB}}/migrations` and executed via `apps/opik-backend/run_db_migrations.sh`. This process is automated via Docker image and helm chart.

In order to run DB DDL migrations manually, you will need to run:
* Check pending migrations `java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar {database} status config.yml`
* Run migrations `java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar {database} migrate config.yml`
* Create schema tag `java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar {database} tag config.yml {tag_name}`
* Rollback migrations `java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar {database} rollback config.yml --count 1` OR `java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar {database} rollback config.yml --tag {tag_name}`

Replace `{project.pom.version}` with the version of the project in the pom file. Replace `{database}` with db for MySQL migrations and with `dbAnalytics` for ClickHouse migrations.

Requirements:
* Such migrations have to be backward compatible, which means:
    - New fields must be optional or have default values
    - In order to remove a column, all references to it must be removed at least one release before the column is dropped at the DB level.
    - Renaming the column is forbidden unless the table is not currently being used.
    - Renaming the table is forbidden unless the table is not currently being used.
    - For more complex migration, apply the transition phase. Refer to [Evolutionary Database Design](https://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html)
* It has to be independent of the code. 
* It must not cause downtime
* It must have a unique name
* It must contain a rollback statement or, in the case of Liquibase, the word `empty` is not possible. Refer to [link](https://docs.liquibase.com/workflows/liquibase-community/using-rollback.html)

*DML migrations*

In such cases, migrations will not run automatically. They have to be run manually by the system admin via the database client. These migrations are documented via `CHANGELOG.md` and placed at `apps/opik-backend/data-migrations` together with all instructions required to run them.

Requirements:
* Such migrations have to be backward compatible, which means:
    - Data shouldn't be deleted unless 100% safe
    - It must not prevent rollback to the previous version
    - It must not degrade performance after running
    - For more complex migration, apply the transition phase. Refer to [Evolutionary Database Design](https://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html)
* It must contain detailed instructions on how to run it
* It must be batched appropriately to avoid disrupting operations 
* It must not cause downtime
* It must have a unique name
* It must contain a rollback statement or, in the case of Liquibase, the word `empty` is not possible. Refer to [link](https://docs.liquibase.com/workflows/liquibase-community/using-rollback.html).

*Accessing Clickhouse*

You can curl the ClickHouse REST endpoint with `echo 'SELECT version()' | curl -H 'X-ClickHouse-User: opik' -H 'X-ClickHouse-Key: opik' 'http://localhost:8123/' -d @-`.
