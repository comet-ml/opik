# Optimizer Algorithm Structure Standards

All optimizer algorithms in the Opik Optimizer SDK must follow a standardized structure for consistency, maintainability, and ease of navigation.

## Required Structure

See `code-structure.mdc` for the canonical algorithm file layout. This file links to the canonical documentation to ensure consistency across all optimizer algorithm implementations.

## Other contracts and guidance
- `run_optimization()` must return `AlgorithmResult`. The base class wraps it into `OptimizationResult`.
- Use `evaluate()` for scoring candidates; it handles counters, early-stop checks, and history logging.
