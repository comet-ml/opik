# Code Style

## Comments
- Don't add comments that restate what code does
- Don't add JSDoc/docstrings unless required by the codebase
- Only comment **why**, not **what**
- No "Added by Claude" or attribution comments
- No placeholder TODOs like `// TODO: implement`

## Don't Over-Engineer
- No helper functions for one-time operations
- No abstractions for single use cases
- No extra error handling "just in case"
- No backwards-compatibility shims when changing code directly works

## Stay Focused
- Only modify code relevant to the task
- No drive-by refactoring of unrelated code
- No reformatting lines you didn't change
- No adding type annotations where inference works
