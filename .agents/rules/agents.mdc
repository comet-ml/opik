# Agent Deployment

## Domain Routing
- `apps/opik-backend/**` → Backend skill
- `apps/opik-frontend/**` → Frontend skill
- `sdks/python/**` → Python SDK skill
- `sdks/opik-typescript/**` → TypeScript SDK skill
- `tests_end_to_end/**` → Playwright E2E skill

## Task Approach
- Complex features → Plan before implementing
- Bug fixes → Reproduce with test first
- Multi-component → Coordinate across domains

## Execution
- Independent tasks → Run in parallel
- Use Opus for: complex planning, security, architecture
- Use Haiku for: simple test runs, formatting
