# Agent Deployment

## Domain Routing
- `apps/opik-backend/**` → Backend skill
- `apps/opik-frontend/**` → Frontend skill
- `sdks/opik_optimizer/**` → Opik Optimizer skill
- `sdks/python/**` → Python SDK skill
- `sdks/typescript/**` → TypeScript SDK skill
- `tests_end_to_end/**` → Playwright E2E skill

## Task Approach
- Complex features → Plan before implementing
- Bug fixes → Reproduce with test first
- Multi-component → Coordinate across domains

## Execution
- Independent tasks → Run in parallel
- Use thinking model (Opus, GPT 5.3, GPT 5.3 High) for: complex planning, security, architecture
- Use fast model (Haiku, GPT Nano, GPT Codex Low/Medium) for: simple test runs, formatting

## Formatting and Linting
- For local verification and PR iterations, run `pre-commit` on changed files, not repository-wide file lists.
- Avoid `--all-files` unless a cleanup migration explicitly requires repository-wide normalization.
