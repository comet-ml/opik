## ⌨️ Comet Debugger Mode

When working with Opik, you can enable **Comet Debugger Mode** to display diagnostic information in the UI. This is particularly useful when troubleshooting issues or reporting bugs.

**Keyboard Shortcut:**
- macOS: `Command + Shift + .`
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + .`

**What it shows:**
- Network status indicator (real-time connectivity to Opik backend)
- Opik version number (clickable to copy to clipboard)

The debugger mode persists across browser sessions and can be toggled on/off using the same keyboard shortcut.
