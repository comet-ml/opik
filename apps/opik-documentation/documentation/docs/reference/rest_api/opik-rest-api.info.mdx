The Opik REST API is currently in beta and subject to change. If you have any questions or feedback about the APIs, please reach out on GitHub: https://github.com/comet-ml/opik.

All of the methods listed in this documentation are used by either the SDK or the UI to interact with the Opik server. As a result,
the methods have been optimized for these use-cases in mind. If you are looking for a method that is not listed above, please create
and issue on GitHub or raise a PR!

Opik includes two main deployment options that results in slightly different API usage:

- **Self-hosted Opik instance:** You will simply need to specify the URL as `http://localhost:5173/api/<endpoint_path>` or similar. This is the default option for the docs.
- **Opik Cloud:** You will need to specify the Opik API Key and Opik Workspace in the header. The format of the header should be:

  ```
  \{
    "Comet-Workspace": "your-workspace-name",
    "authorization": "your-api-key"
  \}
  ```

  Do take note here that the authorization header value does not include the `Bearer ` prefix. To switch to using the Opik Cloud in the documentation, you can
  click on the edit button displayed when hovering over the `Base URL` displayed on the right hand side of the docs.
