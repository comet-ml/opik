**Opik Dashboard**:

- Added the option to sort the projects table by `Last updated`, `Created at` and `Name` columns.
- Updated the logic for displaying images, instead of relying on the format of the response, we now use regex rules to detect if the trace or span input includes a base64 encoded image or url.

- Fixed some issues with rendering trace input and outputs in YAML format.
- Added grouping and charts to the experiments page:

  ```python
  from anthropic import Anthropic, AsyncAnthropic
  from opik.integrations.anthropic import track_anthropic

  client = Anthropic()
  client = track_anthropic(client, project_name="anthropic-example")

  message = client.messages.create(
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Tell a fact",
            }
        ],
        model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    )
  print(message)
  ```

- Added a new `evaluate_experiment` method in the SDK that can be used to re-score an existing experiment, learn more in the [Update experiments](/evaluation/update_existing_experiment.md) guide.

## Week of 2024-11-04

**Opik Dashboard**:

- Added a new `Prompt library` page to manage your prompts in the UI.
  ![prompt library](/img/changelog/2024-11-04/prompt_library_versions.png)

**SDK**:

- Introduced the `Prompt` object in the SDK to manage prompts stored in the library. See the [Prompt Management](/library/managing_prompts_in_code.mdx) guide for more details.

- Allow users to specify the path to the Opik configuration file using the `OPIK_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable, read more about it in the [Python SDK Configuration guide](/tracing/sdk_configuration.mdx#using-a-configuration-file).
- You can now configure the `project_name` as part of the `evaluate` method so that traces are logged to a specific project instead of the default one.
- Added a new `Opik.search_traces` method to search for traces, this includes support for a search string to return only specific traces.
- Enforce structured outputs for LLM as a Judge metrics so that they are more reliable (they will no longer fail when decoding the LLM response).

## Week of 2024-10-21

**Opik Dashboard**:

  ![quickstart guide](/img/changelog/2024-10-21/quickstart_guide.png)
- Updated datasets to support more flexible data schema, you can now insert items with any key value pairs and not just `input` and `expected_output`. See more in the SDK section below.
- Multiple small UX improvements (more informative empty state for projects, updated icons, feedback tab in the experiment page, etc).
- Fix issue with `\t` characters breaking the YAML code block in the traces page.

**SDK**:

- Datasets now support more flexible data schema, we now support inserting items with any key value pairs:

  ```python
  import opik

  client = opik.Opik()
  dataset = client.get_or_create_dataset(name="Demo Dataset")
  dataset.insert([
      {"user_question": "Hello, what can you do ?", "expected_output": {"assistant_answer": "I am a chatbot assistant that can answer questions and help you with your queries!"}},
      {"user_question": "What is the capital of France?", "expected_output": {"assistant_answer": "Paris"}},
  ])
  ```
