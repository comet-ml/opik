# Roadmap

Opik is [Open-Source](https://github.com/comet-opik/opik) and is under very active development. We use the feedback from the Opik community to drive the roadmap, this is very much a living document that will change as we release new features and learn about new ways to improve the product.

If you have any ideas or suggestions for the roadmap, you can create a [new discussion topic](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/discussions/new?category=ideas) in the Opik Github repo.
