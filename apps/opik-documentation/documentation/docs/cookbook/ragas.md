# Using Ragas to evaluate RAG pipelines

In this notebook, we will showcase how to use Opik with Ragas for monitoring and evaluation of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines.

There are two main ways to use Opik with Ragas:

1. Using Ragas metrics to score traces
2. Using the Ragas `evaluate` function to score a dataset

    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your OpenAI API key: ")
```

## Integrating Opik with Ragas

### Using Ragas metrics to score traces

Ragas provides a set of metrics that can be used to evaluate the quality of a RAG pipeline, including but not limited to: `answer_relevancy`, `answer_similarity`, `answer_correctness`, `context_precision`, `context_recall`, `context_entity_recall`, `summarization_score`. You can find a full list of metrics in the [Ragas documentation](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/references/metrics.html#).

These metrics can be computed on the fly and logged to traces or spans in Opik. For this example, we will start by creating a simple RAG pipeline and then scoring it using the `answer_relevancy` metric.

#### Create the Ragas metric

In order to use the Ragas metric without using the `evaluate` function, you need to initialize the metric with a `RunConfig` object and an LLM provider. For this example, we will use LangChain as the LLM provider with the Opik tracer enabled.

We will first start by initializing the Ragas metric:


```python
# Import the metric
from ragas.metrics import AnswerRelevancy

# Import some additional dependencies
from langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_openai.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from ragas.llms import LangchainLLMWrapper
from ragas.embeddings import LangchainEmbeddingsWrapper

# Initialize the Ragas metric
llm = LangchainLLMWrapper(ChatOpenAI())
emb = LangchainEmbeddingsWrapper(OpenAIEmbeddings())

answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancy(llm=llm, embeddings=emb)
```

Once the metric is initialized, you can use it to score a sample question. Given that the metric scoring is done asynchronously, you need to use the `asyncio` library to run the scoring function.


```python
# Run this cell first if you are running this in a Jupyter notebook
import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()
```


```python
import asyncio
from ragas.integrations.opik import OpikTracer
from ragas.dataset_schema import SingleTurnSample
import os

os.environ["OPIK_PROJECT_NAME"] = "ragas-integration"


# Define the scoring function
def compute_metric(metric, row):
    row = SingleTurnSample(**row)

    opik_tracer = OpikTracer(tags=["ragas"])

    async def get_score(opik_tracer, metric, row):
        score = await metric.single_turn_ascore(row, callbacks=[opik_tracer])
        return score

    # Run the async function using the current event loop
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

    result = loop.run_until_complete(get_score(opik_tracer, metric, row))
    return result


# Score a simple example
row = {
    "user_input": "What is the capital of France?",
    "response": "Paris",
    "retrieved_contexts": ["Paris is the capital of France.", "Paris is in France."],
}

score = compute_metric(answer_relevancy_metric, row)
print("Answer Relevancy score:", score)
```

    OPIK: Started logging traces to the "ragas-integration" project at https://www.comet.com/opik/jacques-comet/redirect/projects?name=ragas-integration.


    Answer Relevancy score: 0.9999999999999996


If you now navigate to Opik, you will be able to see that a new trace has been created in the `Default Project` project.

#### Score traces

You can score traces by using the `update_current_trace` function.

The advantage of this approach is that the scoring span is added to the trace allowing for a more fine-grained analysis of the RAG pipeline. It will however run the Ragas metric calculation synchronously and so might not be suitable for production use-cases.


```python
from opik import track, opik_context


@track
def retrieve_contexts(question):
    # Define the retrieval function, in this case we will hard code the contexts
    return ["Paris is the capital of France.", "Paris is in France."]


@track
def answer_question(question, contexts):
    # Define the answer function, in this case we will hard code the answer
    return "Paris"


@track(name="Compute Ragas metric score", capture_input=False)
def compute_rag_score(answer_relevancy_metric, question, answer, contexts):
    # Define the score function
    row = {"user_input": question, "response": answer, "retrieved_contexts": contexts}
    score = compute_metric(answer_relevancy_metric, row)
    return score


@track
def rag_pipeline(question):
    # Define the pipeline
    contexts = retrieve_contexts(question)
    answer = answer_question(question, contexts)

    score = compute_rag_score(answer_relevancy_metric, question, answer, contexts)
    opik_context.update_current_trace(
        feedback_scores=[{"name": "answer_relevancy", "value": round(score, 4)}]
    )

    return answer


rag_pipeline("What is the capital of France?")
```

#### Evaluating datasets using the Opik `evaluate` function

You can use Ragas metrics with the Opik `evaluate` function. This will compute the metrics on all the rows of the dataset and return a summary of the results.

As Ragas metrics are only async, we will need to create a wrapper to be able to use them with the Opik `evaluate` function.


```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from ragas.dataset_schema import SingleTurnSample
from opik.evaluation.metrics import base_metric, score_result
import opik


opik_client = opik.Opik()

# Create a small dataset
fiqa_eval = load_dataset("explodinggradients/fiqa", "ragas_eval")

# Reformat the dataset to match the schema expected by the Ragas evaluate function
hf_dataset = fiqa_eval["baseline"].select(range(3))
dataset_items = hf_dataset.map(
    lambda x: {
        "user_input": x["question"],
        "reference": x["ground_truths"][0],
        "retrieved_contexts": x["contexts"],
    }
)
dataset = opik_client.get_or_create_dataset("ragas-demo-dataset")
dataset.insert(dataset_items)

# Create an evaluation task
def evaluation_task(x):
    return {
        "user_input": x["question"],
        "response": x["answer"],
        "retrieved_contexts": x["contexts"],
    }

# Create scoring metric wrapper
class AnswerRelevancyWrapper(base_metric.BaseMetric):
    def __init__(self, metric):
        self.name = "answer_relevancy_metric"
        self.metric = metric
    
    async def get_score(self, row):
        row = SingleTurnSample(**row)
        score = await self.metric.single_turn_ascore(row)
        return score
    
    def score(self, user_input, response, **ignored_kwargs):
        # Run the async function using the current event loop
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

        result = loop.run_until_complete(self.get_score(row))
        
        return score_result.ScoreResult(
            value=result,
            name=self.name
        )

scoring_metric = AnswerRelevancyWrapper(answer_relevancy_metric)
opik.evaluation.evaluate(
    dataset,
    evaluation_task,
    scoring_metrics=[scoring_metric],
)
```

I would then take the check from my mailbox an either take it to my bank, or scan it and deposit it via their electronic interface. Prior to you mailing it you would have no idea which bank I would use, or what my account number is. In fact I could have multiple bank accounts, so I could decide which one to deposit it into depending on what I wanted to do with the money, or which bank paid the most interest, or by coin flip. Now once the check is deposited my bank would then ""stamp"" the check with their name, their routing number, the date, an my account number. Eventually an image of the canceled check would then end up back at your bank. Which they would either send to you, or make available to you via their banking website. You don\'t mail it to my bank. You mail it to my home, or my business, or wherever I tell you to mail it.

#### Evaluating datasets using the Ragas `evaluate` function

If you looking at evaluating a dataset, you can use the Ragas `evaluate` function. When using this function, the Ragas library will compute the metrics on all the rows of the dataset and return a summary of the results.

You can use the `OpikTracer` callback to log the results of the evaluation to the Opik platform:


```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from ragas.metrics import context_precision, answer_relevancy, faithfulness
from ragas import evaluate

fiqa_eval = load_dataset("explodinggradients/fiqa", "ragas_eval")

# Reformat the dataset to match the schema expected by the Ragas evaluate function
dataset = fiqa_eval["baseline"].select(range(3))

dataset = dataset.map(
    lambda x: {
        "user_input": x["question"],
        "reference": x["ground_truths"][0],
        "retrieved_contexts": x["contexts"],
    }
)

opik_tracer_eval = OpikTracer(tags=["ragas_eval"], metadata={"evaluation_run": True})

result = evaluate(
    dataset,
    metrics=[context_precision, faithfulness, answer_relevancy],
    callbacks=[opik_tracer_eval],
)

print(result)
```
