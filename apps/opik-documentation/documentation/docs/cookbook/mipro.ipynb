      "To enhance the summarization module of the language model program, it is essential to focus on improving its ability to handle complex linguistic features such as sarcasm, irony, mixed sentiments, and other contextual nuances present in customer reviews. Here are specific instructions to optimize the summarization module:\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruction 1: Enhance Sarcasm Detection\n",
      "- Implement algorithms to identify and interpret sarcastic phrases and irony within reviews, ensuring accurate sentiment reflection despite the sarcasm. This can involve training the model on a larger dataset specifically annotated for sarcasm and irony, or integrating existing NLP techniques specialized in sarcasm detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruction 2: Improve Contextual Understanding\n",
      "- Develop mechanisms for better contextual analysis beyond individual word sentiment. Focus on capturing the overarching tone and intent of the review by understanding not just word sentiment, but also the surrounding context that may affect its meaning. Incorporate components like transformers or attention mechanisms that enable the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the text, thereby improving the relevance and accuracy of summaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruction 3: Address Mixed Sentiments with Aspect-based Analysis\n",
      "- Integrate aspect-based sentiment analysis to separately evaluate and balance contrasting sentiments within a review. For sentences containing both positive and negative elements, the module should be capable of determining which sentiment is more dominant, or recognize the presence of both in the summary. This will help in accurately reflecting the overall viewpoint expressed by the reviewer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruction 4: Reinforce Linguistic Pattern Recognition\n",
      "- Bolster the module’s ability to recognize and interpret linguistic patterns, such as contrastive conjunctions (\"but,\" \"however\") and sentiment-laden adjectives, that indicate a shift or emphasis in sentiment within the same sentence. This requires expanding the training data with varied examples highlighting these patterns and refining parsing strategies to focus on nuanced syntactic and semantic signals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruction 5: Introduce Pragmatic Inference Capabilities\n",
      "- Incorporate pragmatic inference capabilities that allow the summarization model to deduce implicit sentiments or conclusions from the provided text. This can involve adding inference layers that provide context-aware judgment of satisfaction levels based on the tone and narrative style, as indicated by phrases such as \"said no one ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these instructions, the summarization module can become more adept at handling the complex and nuanced nature of customer reviews, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant outputs that support the subsequent sentiment analysis.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "To optimize the sentiment analysis module, consider implementing the following instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruction 1: Enhance the model’s ability to detect and interpret sarcasm and irony. Develop or integrate advanced techniques that focus on lexical and contextual cues, such as detecting phrases like \"said no one ever,\" which indicate sarcasm. This will improve the accuracy of sentiment classification in texts where sarcasm is used to express negative sentiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruction 2: Implement aspect-based sentiment analysis mechanisms. Equip the model to identify and evaluate different aspects of experiences or products mentioned in a review. This will enable the model to weigh the sentiment expressed in contrasting elements (positive and negative) and determine the overall sentiment more reliably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruction 3: Develop a system for prioritizing the dominant sentiment when contrastive conjunctions (like \"but,\" \"however\") are present in the text. Ensure that this component reviews the degree of sentiment expressed in the first and second parts and chooses the conclusion or dominant sentiment factor as a key decision point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruction 4: Train the model to better understand humorous contexts, where a negative experience is presented humorously, resulting in an overall positive sentiment. Facilitate this by creating labeled examples explicitly modeled around interpreting humor and its impact on sentiment change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruction 5: Refine the model’s capability to assess pragmatic language use by expanding its context recognition to infer implicit sentiments using language patterns that suggest definitive stances indirectly, such as implied dissatisfaction or satisfaction through humor or exaggerative descriptions.\n",
