    "\n",
    "Ragas provides a set of metrics that can be used to evaluate the quality of a RAG pipeline, including but not limited to: `answer_relevancy`, `answer_similarity`, `answer_correctness`, `context_precision`, `context_recall`, `context_entity_recall`, `summarization_score`. You can find a full list of metrics in the [Ragas documentation](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/references/metrics.html#).\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics can be computed on the fly and logged to traces or spans in Opik. For this example, we will start by creating a simple RAG pipeline and then scoring it using the `answer_relevancy` metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create the Ragas metric\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use the Ragas metric without using the `evaluate` function, you need to initialize the metric with a `RunConfig` object and an LLM provider. For this example, we will use LangChain as the LLM provider with the Opik tracer enabled.\n",
