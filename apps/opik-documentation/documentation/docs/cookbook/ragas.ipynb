You can find a full list of metrics in the [Ragas documentation](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/).\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics can be computed on the fly and logged to traces or spans in Opik. For this example, we will start by creating a simple RAG pipeline and then scoring it using the `answer_relevancy` metric.\n",

    "#### Create the Ragas metric\n",
    "\n",
