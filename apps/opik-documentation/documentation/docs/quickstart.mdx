# Quickstart

This guide helps you integrate the Opik platform with your existing LLM application.

## Set up

Getting started is as simple as creating an [account on Comet](https://www.comet.com/signup?from=llm) or [self-hosting the platform](/self-host/overview.md).

Once your account is created, you can start logging traces by installing the Opik Python SDK:

```bash
pip install opik
```

and configuring the SDK with:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="python" title="Python">
```python
import opik

opik.configure(use_local=False)
```
:::tip
If you are self-hosting the platform, simply set the `use_local` flag to True in the `opik.configure` method.
:::
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" title="Command Line">
```bash
opik configure
```
:::tip
If you are self-hosting the platform, simply use the `opik configure --use_local` command.
:::
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Integrating with your LLM application

You can start logging traces to Opik by simply adding the `@track` decorator to your LLM application:

```python
from opik import track

@track
def your_llm_application(input):
    # Your existing LLM application logic here
    output = "..."
    return output
```

To learn more about the `track` decorator, see the [track documentation](/tracing/log_traces.mdx#logging-traces-and-spans). Once the traces are logged, you can view them in the OPIK UI:
