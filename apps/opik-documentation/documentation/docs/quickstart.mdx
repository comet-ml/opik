# Quickstart

This guide helps you integrate the Opik platform with your existing LLM application. The goal of this guide is to help you log your first LLM calls and chains to the Opik platform.

![Opik Traces](/img/home/traces_page_for_quickstart.png)

## Set up

Getting started is as simple as creating an [account on Comet](https://www.comet.com/signup?from=llm) or [self-hosting the platform](/self-host/overview.md).

Once your account is created, you can start logging traces by installing the Opik Python SDK:

```bash
pip install opik
```

and configuring the SDK with:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Python" title="Python">

```python
import opik

opik.configure(use_local=False)
```

:::tip
If you are self-hosting the platform, simply set the `use_local` flag to True in the `opik.configure` method.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Command Line" title="cli">

```bash
opik configure
```

:::tip
If you are self-hosting the platform, simply use the `opik configure --use_local` command.

## Adding Opik observability to your codebase

### Logging LLM calls

The first step in integrating Opik with your codebase is to track your LLM calls. If you are using OpenAI or any LLM provider that is supported by LiteLLM, you
can use one of our [integrations](/tracing/integrations/overview.md):

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="OpenAI" title="OpenAI">

```python
from opik.integrations.openai import track_openai
from openai import OpenAI

# Wrap your OpenAI client
openai_client = OpenAI()
openai_client = track_openai(openai_client)
```

All OpenAI calls made using the `openai_client` will now be logged to Opik.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="LiteLLM" title="LiteLLM">

```python
from litellm.integrations.opik.opik import OpikLogger
import litellm

# Wrap your LiteLLM client
opik_logger = OpikLogger()
litellm.callbacks = [opik_logger]
```

All LiteLLM calls made using the `litellm` client will now be logged to Opik.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Any other provider" title="Any other provider">

If you are using an LLM provider that Opik does not have an integration for, you can still log the LLM calls by using the `@track` decorator:

```python
from opik import track
import anthropic

@track
def call_llm(client, messages):
    return client.messages.create(messages=messages)

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

call_llm(client, [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is tracking and evaluation of LLMs important?"}])
```

The `@track` decorator will automatically log the input and output of the decorated function allowing you to track the user
messages and the LLM responses in Opik. If you want to log more than just the input and output, you can use the `update_current_span` function
as described in the [Traces / Logging Additional Data section](/tracing/log_traces.mdx#logging-additional-data).

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Logging chains

It is common for LLM applications to use chains rather than just calling the LLM once. This is achieved by either using a framework
like [LangChain](/tracing/integrations/langchain.md), [LangGraph](/tracing/integrations/langgraph.md) or [LLamaIndex](/tracing/integrations/llama_index.md),
or by writing custom python code.

Opik makes it easy for your to log your chains no matter how you implement them:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Custom Python Code" title="Custom Python Code">

If you are not using any frameworks to build your chains, you can use the `@track` decorator to log your chains. When a
function is decorated with `@track`, the input and output of the function will be logged to Opik. This works well even for very
nested chains:

```python
from opik import track
from opik.integrations.openai import track_openai
from openai import OpenAI

# Wrap your OpenAI client
openai_client = OpenAI()
openai_client = track_openai(openai_client)

# Create your chain
@track
def llm_chain(input_text):
    context = retrieve_context(input_text)
    response = generate_response(input_text, context)

    return response

@track
def retrieve_context(input_text):
    # For the purpose of this example, we are just returning a hardcoded list of strings
    context =[
        "What specific information are you looking for?",
        "How can I assist you with your interests today?",
        "Are there any topics you'd like to explore or learn more about?",
    ]
    return context

@track
def generate_response(input_text, context):
    full_prompt = (
        f" If the user asks a question that is not specific, use the context to provide a relevant response.\n"
        f"Context: {', '.join(context)}\n"
        f"User: {input_text}\n"
        f"AI:"
    )

    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": full_prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

llm_chain("Hello, how are you?")
```

While this code sample assumes that you are using OpenAI, the same principle applies if you are using any other LLM provider.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="LangChain" title="LangChain">

If you are using LangChain to build your chains, you can use the `OpikTracer` to log your chains. The `OpikTracer` is a LangChain callback that will
log every step of the chain to Opik:

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from opik.integrations.langchain import OpikTracer

# Initialize the tracer
opik_tracer = OpikTracer()

# Create the LLM Chain using LangChain
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["input"],
    template="Translate the following text to French: {input}"
)

# Use pipe operator to create LLM chain
llm_chain = prompt_template | llm

# Generate the translations
llm_chain.invoke({"input": "Hello, how are you?"}, callbacks=[opik_tracer])
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="LLamaIndex" title="LLamaIndex">

If you are using LLamaIndex you can set `opik` as a global callback to log all LLM calls:

```python
from llama_index.core import global_handler, set_global_handler

set_global_handler("opik")
opik_callback_handler = global_handler
```

You LlamaIndex calls from that point forward will be logged to Opik. You can learn more about the LlamaIndex integration in the [LLamaIndex integration docs](/tracing/integrations/llama_index.md).

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::info
Your chains will now be logged to Opik and can be viewed in the Opik UI. To learn more about how you can customize the logged data, see the [Log Traces](/tracing/log_traces.mdx) guide.

## Next steps

Now that you have logged your first LLM calls and chains to Opik, why not check out:

1. [Opik's evaluation metrics](/evaluation/metrics/overview.md): Opik provides a suite of evaluation metrics (Hallucination, Answer Relevance, Context Recall, etc.) that you can use to score your LLM responses.
2. [Opik Experiments](/evaluation/concepts.md): Opik allows you to automated the evaluation process of your LLM application so that you no longer need to manually review every LLM response.
