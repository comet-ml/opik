# Track agents

When working with agents, it can become challenging to track the flow of the agent and its interactions with the environment.
Opik provides a way to track both the agent definition and it's flow.

Opik includes an integration with many popular Agent frameworks:

- [LangGrah](/tracing/integrations/langgraph.md)
- [LLamaIndex](/tracing/integrations/llama_index.md)
