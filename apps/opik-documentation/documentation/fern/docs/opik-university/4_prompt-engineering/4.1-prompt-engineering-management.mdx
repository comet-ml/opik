## Scaling Prompt Engineering with Systematic Management

This video addresses a critical but often overlooked aspect of LLM application development: [prompt management](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management). As applications grow, teams can end up with dozens or hundreds of [prompts](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management) that become duplicated, outdated, or inconsistently applied without proper organization. You'll learn how Opik's [prompt management](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management) features help organize, version, and share [prompts](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management) across teams, transforming chaotic prompt handling into systematic, scalable workflows.

## Key Highlights

- **Systematic Organization**: Organize [prompts](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management) into logical "prompt buckets" with clear naming conventions (project-based + prompt type) to prevent chaos as you scale
- **Complete Version History**: Track full commit history with 16+ versions per [prompt](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management), including timestamps and commit messages for complete prompt evolution visibility
- **[Experiment](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/evaluate_your_llm) Integration**: See all [experiments](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/evaluate_your_llm) connected to specific [prompts](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management), making it easy to identify which prompt variations performed best across different test runs
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Use compare features to analyze differences between [prompt](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management) versions, enabling data-driven prompt optimization decisions
- **Rich Metadata Support**: Attach key-value metadata to [prompts](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management) as standard JSON objects for additional context and organization
- **Programmatic Management**: Use [`opik.Prompt`](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/managing_prompts_in_code) class to create and commit [prompts](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management) directly from code, integrating prompt management into development workflows
- **Team Collaboration**: Tag and share [prompts](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management) across team members, ensuring consistency and preventing duplication across projects
- **Performance Tracking**: View attached [metrics](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/overview) from [experiments](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/evaluate_your_llm) directly in prompt views, connecting prompt changes to performance outcomes
- **[Playground](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/playground) Integration**: Seamlessly use tracked [prompts](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/prompt_management) in Opik's [playground](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/prompt_engineering/playground) for testing and iteration (covered in next video)
