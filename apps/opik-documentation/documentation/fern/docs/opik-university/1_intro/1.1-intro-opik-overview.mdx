## What is Opik?

Opik is Comet's comprehensive platform for LLM [observability](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/log_traces), [evaluation](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/overview), and [monitoring](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/production/production_monitoring), designed to support you across the entire LLM lifecycle from development to production. This video provides a complete overview of Opik's core capabilities and shows how it can transform your approach to building and maintaining LLM applications.

## Key Highlights

- **Complete LLM Lifecycle Support**: From initial development through production deployment and [monitoring](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/production/production_monitoring)
- **Centralized [Tracing](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/log_traces)**: Track all interactions with your LLM applications in one location, making it easy to identify issues and debug complex chains
- **Automated [Evaluation](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/overview)**: Replace ad-hoc "vibe checks" with consistent, reproducible evaluations using standardized [datasets](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/manage_datasets) and [metrics](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/metrics/overview)
- **[Production Monitoring](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/production/production_monitoring)**: Deploy with confidence using [testing](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/testing/pytest_integration) and monitoring tools that track performance in real-time
- **Open Source + Enterprise**: Get the flexibility of open source with the security, scalability, and support of an enterprise solution
- **Rich [Integration](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/integrations/overview) Ecosystem**: Works seamlessly with popular frameworks like [OpenAI](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/integrations/openai), Azure, and many others
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Extensive docs with [quickstart](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/quickstart) guides, [integrations](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/integrations/overview), and hands-on Jupyter notebook [cookbooks](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/integrations/overview) that run directly in Google Colab
