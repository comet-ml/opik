## What is Opik?

Opik is Comet's comprehensive platform for LLM [observability](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/log_traces), [evaluation](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/evaluation/overview), and [monitoring](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/production/production_monitoring), designed to support you across the entire LLM lifecycle from development to production. This video provides a complete overview of Opik's core capabilities and shows how it can transform your approach to building and maintaining LLM applications.
