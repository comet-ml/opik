# Opik Bounty Program

Welcome to the Opik Bounty Program! We're excited to collaborate with our community to improve and expand the Opik platform. This program is a great way for you to contribute to an open-source project, showcase your skills, and get rewarded for your efforts.

## What is the Opik Bounty Program?

The Opik Bounty Program allows developers and contributors like you to tackle specific issues, feature requests, or documentation improvements in exchange for monetary rewards. We believe in the power of community and want to incentivize valuable contributions that help make Opik better for everyone.

## How to Participate

2.  **Understand the Requirements**: Each bounty will have a clear description of the task, expected deliverables, and the reward amount. Make sure you understand what's needed before you start working.
3.  **Claim a Bounty (if applicable)**: Some bounties might require you to claim them before working. Follow the instructions on the bounty platform.
4.  **Work on the Bounty**: Once you've picked a bounty, get to work! You can always ask for clarification in the relevant GitHub issue.
5.  **Submit Your Contribution**: Typically, this involves submitting a Pull Request to the Opik GitHub repository. Make sure to link to the bounty issue in your PR.
6.  **Get Rewarded**: Once your contribution is reviewed, merged, and meets the bounty requirements, you'll receive your reward through the Algora platform.
