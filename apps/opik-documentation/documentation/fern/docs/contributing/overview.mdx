## Project Setup and Architecture

The Opik project is made up of five main sub-projects:

*   `apps/opik-documentation`: The Opik documentation website (this site!)
*   `deployment/installer`: The Opik installer
*   `sdks/python`: The Opik Python SDK
*   `apps/opik-frontend`: The Opik frontend application
*   `apps/opik-backend`: The Opik backend server

Opik relies on: Clickhouse (traces, spans, feedback), MySQL (metadata), and Redis (caching).

The local development environment is based on `docker-compose`. Please see instructions in the [deployment/docker-compose/README.md](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/deployment/docker-compose/README.md) on GitHub.
