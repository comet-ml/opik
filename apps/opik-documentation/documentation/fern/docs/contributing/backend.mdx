# Contributing to the Backend

This guide will help you get started with contributing to the Opik backend.

## Project Structure

The Opik backend is a Java application (source in `apps/opik-backend`) that forms the core of the Opik platform. It handles data ingestion, storage, API requests, and more.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

<Steps>
  ### 1. Run External Dependencies
  The backend relies on Clickhouse, MySQL, and Redis. You can start these using Docker Compose from the `deployment/docker-compose` directory in the repository:
  
  ```bash
  cd deployment/docker-compose
  
  # Optionally, force a pull of the latest images
  # docker compose pull
  
  docker compose up clickhouse redis mysql -d
  ```

### 2. Install Prerequisites for Backend Development

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version specified in `pom.xml` (e.g., JDK 17 or newer)
- Apache Maven - For building the project

### 3. Build and Run the Backend Locally

Navigate to the backend project directory and use Maven commands:

```bash
cd apps/opik-backend

# Build the Opik application (compiles, runs tests, packages)
mvn clean install

# Start the Opik application server
java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar server config.yml
```

Replace `{project.pom.version}` with the actual version number found in the `pom.xml` file (e.g., `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`).
Once started, the Opik API should be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 4. Code Formatting

We use Spotless for code formatting. Before submitting a PR, please ensure your code is formatted correctly:

```bash
cd apps/opik-backend
mvn spotless:apply
```

Our CI (Continuous Integration) will check formatting using `mvn spotless:check` and fail the build if it's not correct.

### 5. Running Tests

Ensure your changes pass all backend tests:

```bash
cd apps/opik-backend
mvn test
```

Tests leverage the `testcontainers` library to run integration tests against real instances of external services (Clickhouse, MySQL, etc.). Ports for these services are randomly assigned by the library during tests to avoid conflicts.

### 6. Submitting a Pull Request

After implementing your changes, ensuring tests pass, and code is formatted, commit your work and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the `comet-ml/opik` repository.

## Advanced Backend Topics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Health Check">
    To check the health of your locally running backend application, you can access the health check endpoint in your browser or via `curl` at `http://localhost:8080/healthcheck`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database Migrations (Liquibase)">
    Opik uses [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.com/) for managing database schema changes (DDL migrations) for both MySQL and ClickHouse.

    - **Location**: Migrations are located at `apps/opik-backend/src/main/resources/liquibase/{{DB}}/migrations` (where `{{DB}}` is `db` for MySQL or `dbAnalytics` for ClickHouse).
    - **Automation**: Execution is typically automated via the `apps/opik-backend/run_db_migrations.sh` script, Docker images, and Helm charts in deployed environments.
    - **Manual Execution**:
      To run DDL migrations manually (replace `{project.pom.version}` and `{database}` as needed):
      - Check pending migrations: `java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar {database} status config.yml`
      - Run migrations: `java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar {database} migrate config.yml`
      - Create schema tag: `java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar {database} tag config.yml {tag_name}`
      - Rollback migrations: `java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar {database} rollback config.yml --count 1` OR `java -jar target/opik-backend-{project.pom.version}.jar {database} rollback config.yml --tag {tag_name}`
    - **Requirements for DDL Migrations**:
      *   Must be backward compatible (new fields optional/defaulted, column removal in stages, no renaming of active tables/columns).
      *   Must be independent of application code changes.
      *   Must not cause downtime.
      *   Must have a unique name.
      *   Must contain a rollback statement (or use `empty` if Liquibase cannot auto-generate one). Refer to [Evolutionary Database Design](https://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html) and [Liquibase Rollback Docs](https://docs.liquibase.com/workflows/liquibase-community/using-rollback.html).

<Accordion title="Data Migrations (DML)">
  DML (Data Manipulation Language) migrations are for changes to data itself, not the schema. - **Execution**: These are
  not run automatically. They must be run manually by a system admin using a database client. - **Documentation**: DML
  migrations are documented in `CHANGELOG.md` (link to GitHub:
  [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)) and the scripts are placed at
  `apps/opik-backend/data-migrations` along with detailed instructions. - **Requirements for DML Migrations**: * Must be
  backward compatible (no data deletion unless 100% safe, allow rollback, no performance degradation). * Must include
  detailed execution instructions. * Must be batched appropriately to avoid disrupting operations. * Must not cause
  downtime. * Must have a unique name. * Must contain a rollback statement.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Accessing ClickHouse Directly">
    You can query the ClickHouse REST endpoint directly. For example, to get the version:
    ```bash
    echo 'SELECT version()' | curl -H 'X-ClickHouse-User: opik' -H 'X-ClickHouse-Key: opik' 'http://localhost:8123/' -d @-
    ```
    Sample output: `23.8.15.35`
