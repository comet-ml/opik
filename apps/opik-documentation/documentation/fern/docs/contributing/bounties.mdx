## What is the Opik Bounty Program?

The Opik Bounty Program allows developers and contributors like you to tackle specific issues, feature requests, or documentation improvements in exchange for monetary rewards. We believe in the power of community and want to incentivize valuable contributions that help make Opik better for everyone.

## How to Participate

<Steps>
  ### 1. Review Guidelines
  Before diving in, please make sure you've read our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/CLA.md) and the main [Contribution Guide](/contributing/overview). This ensures you understand our development process and legal requirements.

  ### 2. Find a Bounty
  Browse open bounties on our official [Algora Bounty Board](https://algora.io/comet-ml). Look for tasks that match your skills and interests.

  ### 3. Understand the Requirements
  Each bounty will have a clear description of the task, expected deliverables, and the reward amount. Make sure you understand what's needed before you start working. If anything is unclear, ask for clarification in the relevant GitHub issue associated with the bounty.

  ### 4. Claim a Bounty (if applicable)
  Some bounties might require you to claim them on the Algora platform before starting work. Follow the specific instructions provided on the bounty listing.

  ### 5. Work on Your Contribution
  Once you've picked and (if necessary) claimed a bounty, it's time to get to work! Adhere to the coding and contribution guidelines outlined in our main [Contribution Guide](/contributing/overview).

  ### 6. Submit Your Contribution
  Typically, this involves submitting a Pull Request (PR) to the appropriate Opik GitHub repository. Make sure to clearly link to the bounty issue in your PR description.

  ### 7. Get Rewarded
  Once your contribution is reviewed, merged by the Opik team, and meets all the bounty requirements, you'll receive your reward through the Algora platform.
