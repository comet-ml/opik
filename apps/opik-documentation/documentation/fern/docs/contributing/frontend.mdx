## Project Structure

The Opik frontend is a React application located in the `apps/opik-frontend` directory of the `comet-ml/opik` repository. It provides the user interface for interacting with the Opik platform.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

We provide multiple ways to develop the frontend. Choose the approach that best fits your workflow:

<Tabs>
  <Tab value="Local Process Mode" title="Local Process Mode (Recommended)">
    **Best for rapid development with hot reload**

    This mode runs the frontend as a local process with Vite's dev server, providing instant hot reload when you save files:

    ```bash
    # From repository root - restart everything
    scripts/dev-runner.sh

    # Or just start (faster if already built)
    scripts/dev-runner.sh --start
    ```

    Access the UI at `http://localhost:5174` (Vite dev server with hot reload).

    **Benefits:**
    - Instant hot reload on file changes
    - Fast rebuilds
    - Full TypeScript type checking and linting
    - Easy debugging with browser dev tools

    **Prerequisites:**
    - Node.js 18+ with npm
    - Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 (for backend)
    - Apache Maven 3.8+ (for backend)
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Docker Mode" title="Docker Mode">
    **Best for testing the complete system**

    This mode runs everything in Docker containers:

    ```bash
    # From repository root
    ./opik.sh --build

    # Or start without rebuilding
    ./opik.sh
    ```

    Access the UI at `http://localhost:5173`.

    **Benefits:**
    - Closest to production environment
    - No local Node.js installation needed
    - Consistent environment across team

    **Prerequisites:**
    - Docker and Docker Compose
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Manual Setup" title="Manual Setup">
    **Best for understanding the build process**

    Set up each component manually:

    1. **Start backend services:**
       ```bash
       ./opik.sh --backend --port-mapping
       ```

    2. **Configure environment variables:**
       Create `apps/opik-frontend/.env.development`:
       ```ini
       VITE_BASE_URL=/
       VITE_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
       ```

    3. **Install dependencies:**
       ```bash
       cd apps/opik-frontend
       npm install
       ```

    4. **Start the frontend:**
       ```bash
       npm run start
       ```

    Access the UI at `http://localhost:5174`.

    **Prerequisites:**
    - Node.js 18+ with npm
    - Docker and Docker Compose (for backend)
  </Tab>

### 8. Making Changes and Submitting a PR

Now you can make your code changes in the `apps/opik-frontend` directory. Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure your code passes the following checks:

```bash
cd apps/opik-frontend

npm run e2e       # End-to-end tests
npm run lint      # Linter checks
npm run typecheck # TypeScript type checking
```

Commit your changes and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the `comet-ml/opik` repository.
