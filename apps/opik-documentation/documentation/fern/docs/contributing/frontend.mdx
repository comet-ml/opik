## Project Structure

The Opik frontend is a React application located in the `apps/opik-frontend` directory of the `comet-ml/opik` repository. It provides the user interface for interacting with the Opik platform.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Follow these steps to run the frontend locally and see your changes instantly upon saving files:

<Steps>
  ### 1. Prerequisites
  Ensure you have **Node.js** (which includes npm) installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Navigate to the `apps/opik-frontend/` directory and create or update the `.env.development` file with the following values:

```ini
VITE_BASE_URL=/
VITE_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

This tells the frontend development server where to find the backend API.

### 3. Enable CORS in the Back-End

For local development, the backend needs to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) from the frontend development server.

- Open `deployment/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml` in the root of the repository (view on [GitHub](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/deployment/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml)).
- In the `services.backend.environment` section, add `CORS: true`:

  ```yaml
  ---
  OPIK_USAGE_REPORT_ENABLED: ${OPIK_USAGE_REPORT_ENABLED:-true}
  CORS: true # Add this line
  ```

- If your backend services are already running via Docker Compose, you might need to restart them for this change to take effect: `docker compose down && docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.override.yaml up -d`

### 4. Start Required Backend Services

The frontend relies on various backend services. Run the following command from the root of the repository to start them (along with other necessary services like the database):

```bash
# Optionally, you can force a pull of the latest images first
# docker compose pull

docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.override.yaml up -d
```

### 5. Verify the Back-End is Running

Wait for the Docker containers to build and start. To confirm that the backend is running successfully, open `http://localhost:8080/is-alive/ver` in your browser.
If you see a version number displayed, the backend is ready.

### 6. Install Front-End Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend project directory:

```bash
cd apps/opik-frontend
```

Install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 7. Start the Front-End Development Server

Run the following command to start the frontend:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the script completes, open `http://localhost:5174/` in your browser.
You should see the Opik app running! ðŸŽ‰

{" "}

<Tip title="Alternative Build Port">
  Another built version of the frontend (served by the backend) will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`. The
  `localhost:5174` instance provides hot-reloading and is generally preferred for active development.
</Tip>

### 8. Making Changes and Submitting a PR

Now you can make your code changes in the `apps/opik-frontend` directory. Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure your code passes the following checks:

```bash
cd apps/opik-frontend

npm run e2e       # End-to-end tests
npm run lint      # Linter checks
npm run typecheck # TypeScript type checking
```

Commit your changes and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the `comet-ml/opik` repository.

</Steps>
