# Contributing to the Opik Python SDK

The Opik Python SDK is a key component of our platform, allowing developers to integrate Opik into their Python applications seamlessly. The SDK source code is located in the `sdks/python` directory of the main `comet-ml/opik` repository.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  ### 1. Set up Opik Locally
  To develop and test Python SDK features, you'll need a local Opik instance running. You can set this up by following the instructions in the [Docker Compose README](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/deployment/docker-compose/README.md) or by using the helper scripts provided in the root of the repository:

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Linux/Mac">
    ```bash
    # From the root of the repository
    ./opik.sh

    # Configure the Python SDK to point to the local Opik deployment
    opik configure --use_local
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    # From the root of the repository
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c ".\opik.ps1"

    # Configure the Python SDK to point to the local Opik deployment
    opik configure --use_local
    ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>
  Your local Opik server will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

  <Tip title="Windows Users">
    - Ensure the Python `Scripts` directory (e.g., `C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python<version>\Scripts\`) is in your system's PATH for the `opik` CLI command to work after installation. Restart your terminal after adding it.
    - Using a Python virtual environment is highly recommended:
      ```powershell
      # Create a virtual environment
      py -m venv my-opik-env
      
      # Activate it (example path)
      cd my-opik-env\Scripts && .\activate.bat
      
      # Install the SDK in editable mode (adjust path to sdks/python from your current location)
      pip install -e ../../sdks/python 
      
      # Configure the SDK to use your local Opik instance
      opik configure --use_local
      ```
  </Tip>

### 2. Install SDK for Development

Navigate to the `sdks/python` directory (or use the path from your virtual environment setup) and install the SDK in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Review Coding Guidelines

Familiarize yourself with the [coding guidelines for our Python SDK](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/blob/main/sdks/python/README.md). This will cover style, conventions, and other important aspects.

### 4. Implement Your Changes

Make your desired code changes, additions, or bug fixes within the `sdks/python` directory.

### 5. Test Your Changes

Testing is crucial. For most SDK contributions, you should run the end-to-end (e2e) tests:

```bash
cd sdks/python # Ensure you are in this directory

# Install test-specific requirements
pip install -r tests/test_requirements.txt

# Install pre-commit for linting checks (optional but good practice)
pip install pre-commit

# Run e2e tests
pytest tests/e2e
```

If you're making changes to specific integrations (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic):

1. Install the integration-specific requirements: `pip install -r tests/integrations/openai/requirements.txt` (example for OpenAI).
2. Configure any necessary API keys for the integration as environment variables or per your test setup.
3. Run the specific integration tests: `pytest tests/integrations/openai` (example for OpenAI).

### 6. Run Linters

Ensure your code adheres to our linting standards:

```bash
cd sdks/python
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 7. Update Documentation (If Applicable)

If your changes impact public-facing methods, parameters, or docstrings, please also update the documentation. Refer to the [Documentation Contribution Guide](/contributing/guides/documentation) for how to update the Python SDK Reference Documentation (Sphinx).

### 8. Submit a Pull Request

Once all tests and checks pass, and any relevant documentation is updated, commit your changes and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the `comet-ml/opik` repository. Clearly describe your changes and link to any relevant issues.
