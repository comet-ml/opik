## Documentation Structure

This guide covers how to contribute to the two main parts of Opik's documentation: **This Documentation Website**: Built with [Fern](https://www.buildwithfern.com/) and **Python SDK Reference Documentation**: Built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

Here's how you can work with either one:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Contributing to this Documentation Website (Fern)">
    This website (source in `apps/opik-documentation/documentation`) is where our main guides, tutorials, and conceptual documentation live.

    <Steps>
      ### 1. Install Prerequisites
      Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can follow the official guide [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/).

      ### 2. Set up Locally
      ```bash
      cd apps/opik-documentation/documentation

      # Install dependencies - Only needs to be run once
      npm install

      # Optional - Install Python dependencies if updating Jupyter Cookbooks
      pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Run the documentation website locally
      npm run dev


      ```
      Access the local site at `http://localhost:3000`. Changes will update in real-time.

      ### 3. Make Your Changes
      Update content primarily in:
      - `fern/docs/`: Main markdown content (like this page).
      - `/docs/cookbook`: Our collection of cookbooks and examples - Please note that you should not be updating the `cookbook` markdown files directly as they are generated from the Jupyter Notebook.

      Refer to the `docs.yml` file for the overall structure and navigation.

      ### 4. Submitting Changes
      Once you're happy with your changes, commit them and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the `comet-ml/opik` repository.
    </Steps>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contributing to the Python SDK Reference Documentation (Sphinx)">
    The Python SDK reference docs (source in `apps/opik-documentation/python-sdk-docs`) are generated from docstrings in the Python codebase using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
    <Steps>
      ### 1. Install Prerequisites
      Ensure you have Python and pip installed. A virtual environment is highly recommended.

      ### 2. Set up Locally
      ```bash
      cd apps/opik-documentation/python-sdk-docs
      # Install dependencies - Only needs to be run once
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      # Run the python sdk reference documentation locally
      make dev
      ```
      Access the local site at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Changes will update in real-time as you modify docstrings in the SDK (`sdks/python`) and rebuild.

      ### 3. Making Changes
      Improvements to the SDK reference usually involve updating the Python docstrings directly in the SDK source files located in the `sdks/python` directory.

      ### 4. Building and Previewing
      After editing docstrings, run `make dev` (or `make html` for a one-time build) in the `apps/opik-documentation/python-sdk-docs` directory to regenerate the HTML and preview your changes.

      ### 5. Submitting Changes
      Commit your changes to both the Python SDK source files and any necessary updates in the `python-sdk-docs` directory. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
