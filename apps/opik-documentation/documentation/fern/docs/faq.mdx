These FAQs are a collection of the most common questions that we've received from our users. If you have any questions or need additional assistance,
please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/issues).

## General

### What is Opik's relationship with Comet?

Opik is developed by Comet and is available in multiple deployment options:
- As an open-source standalone product that can be used locally or self-hosted on your own infrastructure
- As an integrated part of the Comet MLOps Platform (both in Comet-hosted and self-hosted deployments)

This means you can use Opik independently of the Comet platform, or as part of your existing Comet MLOps setup.

### What SDKs does Opik provide?

Opik currently provides official SDKs for:
- Python: Our most feature-complete SDK, supporting all Opik features
- TypeScript: Rich tracing capabilities

These SDKs are actively maintained and regularly updated. For other languages, you can use our REST API directly - see our [API documentation](/docs/opik/reference/rest-api/overview) for details.

### Can I use Opik to monitor my LLM application in production?

Yes, Opik has been designed from the ground up to be used to monitor production applications. If you are self-hosting the
Opik platform, we recommend using the [Kubernetes deployment](/self-host/overview) option to ensure that Opik can scale as needed.

## Opik Cloud

### Are there are rate limits on Opik Cloud?

Yes, in order to ensure all users have a good experience we have implemented rate limits. Each user is limited to `10,000`
events per minute, an event is a trace, span, feedback score, dataset item, experiment item, etc. If you need to increase
this limit please reach out to us on [Slack](https://chat.comet.com).

## Integrations

### What integrations does Opik support?

Opik supports a wide range of popular LLM frameworks and providers. You can find detailed integration guides in our [cookbook section](/cookbook/overview#integration-examples) for:

- LLM Providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Gemini, Groq, IBM watsonx, Ollama
- Frameworks: LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, DSPy, CrewAI, LangGraph
- Tools: LiteLLM, Guardrails, Ragas, aisuite
- And more!

### What if Opik doesn't support my preferred framework or tool?

If you don't see your preferred framework or tool listed in our integrations, we encourage you to:

1. Open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/issues) to request the integration
2. In the meantime, you can manually log your LLM interactions using our SDK's core logging functions - see our [tracing documentation](/docs/opik/tracing/log_traces) for examples

We actively maintain and expand our integration support based on community feedback.

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I getting 403 errors?

If you're encountering 403 (Forbidden) errors, this typically indicates an authentication or authorization issue. If you haven't configured your credentials yet, the easiest way to get started is to run:
```bash
opik configure
```
This interactive command will guide you through setting up the required configuration.

Otherwise, please double-check your existing configuration:

For Opik Cloud by Comet:
- `api_key` (required): Verify your API key is correct and active
- `workspace` (required): Confirm you have access to the specified workspace
- `project_name` (optional): If specified, ensure the project name is valid
- `url_override`: Should be set to `https://www.comet.com/opik/api` (this is the default)

For Self-hosted Opik:
- `url_override` (required): Verify your base URL points to your Opik instance (e.g., `http://your-instance:5173/api`)

You can find your current configuration in the Opik configuration file (`~/.opik.config`) or by checking your environment variables (`OPIK_API_KEY`, `OPIK_WORKSPACE`, `OPIK_URL_OVERRIDE`, `OPIK_PROJECT_NAME`). For more details on configuration, see our [SDK Configuration guide](/docs/opik/tracing/sdk_configuration).

## How can I diagnose issues with Opik?


If you are experiencing any problems using Opik, such as receiving 400 or 500 errors from the backend, or being unable to connect at all, we recommend running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
opik healthcheck
```
This command will analyze your configuration and backend connectivity, providing useful insights into potential issues.
