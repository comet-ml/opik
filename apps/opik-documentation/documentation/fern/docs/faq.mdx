These FAQs are a collection of the most common questions that we've received from our users. If you have any questions or need additional assistance,
please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/issues).

## General

### What is Opik's relationship with Comet?

Opik is developed by Comet and is available in multiple deployment options:

- As an open-source standalone product that can be used locally or self-hosted on your own infrastructure
- As an integrated part of the Comet MLOps Platform (both in Comet-hosted and self-hosted deployments)

This means you can use Opik independently of the Comet platform, or as part of your existing Comet MLOps setup.

### What SDKs does Opik provide?

Opik currently provides official SDKs for:

- Python: Our most feature-complete SDK, supporting all Opik features
- TypeScript: Rich tracing capabilities

These SDKs are actively maintained and regularly updated. For other languages, you can use our REST API directly - see our [API documentation](/docs/opik/reference/rest-api/overview) for details.

### Can I use Opik to monitor my LLM application in production?

Yes, Opik has been designed from the ground up to be used to monitor production applications. If you are self-hosting the
Opik platform, we recommend using the [Kubernetes deployment](/self-host/overview) option to ensure that Opik can scale as needed.

### What is the difference between Opik Cloud and the Open-Source Opik platform ?

The Opik Cloud platform is the hosted version of Opik that is available to both
free users and paying customers. It includes all the features you love about
the open-source version of Opik, plus user management, billing and support without
the hassle of setting up and maintaining your own Opik platform.

The Open-Source version of the Opik product includes tracing and online evaluation
features so you can monitor your LLMs in production. It also includes advanced
evaluation features including evaluation metrics and an advanced experiment
comparison UI. Less technical users can also use Opik to review production traces
or run experiments from the Opik Playground.

## Opik Cloud

### Where can I find my Opik API key ?

The Opik API key is needed to log data to either the Opik Cloud platform. You can
find your API key in either your Account settings or in the user menu available
from the top right of the page

<Tip>
  If you are using the Open-Source Opik platform, you will not have Opik API keys. You can configure Opik by running
  `opik configure` in your terminal which will prompt you for your Opik deployment and create all the required
  configurations.
</Tip>

### Are there are rate limits on Opik Cloud?

Yes, in order to ensure all users have a good experience we have implemented rate limits.

There's a global rate limit of `2,000` request/minute per user across all REST API endpoints, with an extra burst of
`100` requests.

Afterward, there's a data ingestion limit of `10,000` events/minute per user. An event is any trace, span,
feedback score, dataset item, experiment item, etc. which is ingested, stored and persisted by Opik.

Additionally, there's another data ingestion limit of `5,000` events/minute per workspace and per user.

Finally, there's a rate limit of `250` requests/minute per user for the `Get span by id` endpoint:
`GET /api/v1/private/spans/:id`.

For questions about rate limits, reach out to us on [Slack](https://chat.comet.com).

## Integrations

### What integrations does Opik support?

Opik supports a wide range of popular LLM frameworks and providers. You can find detailed integration guides in our [cookbook section](/cookbook/overview#integration-examples) for:

- LLM Providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Gemini, Groq, IBM watsonx, Ollama
- Frameworks: LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, DSPy, CrewAI, LangGraph
- Tools: LiteLLM, Guardrails, Ragas, aisuite
- And more!

### What if Opik doesn't support my preferred framework or tool?

If you don't see your preferred framework or tool listed in our integrations, we encourage you to:

1. Open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/issues) to request the integration
2. In the meantime, you can manually log your LLM interactions using our SDK's core logging functions - see our [tracing documentation](/docs/opik/tracing/log_traces) for examples

We actively maintain and expand our integration support based on community feedback.

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I getting 403 errors?

If you're encountering 403 (Forbidden) errors, this typically indicates an authentication or authorization issue. If you haven't configured your credentials yet, the easiest way to get started is to run:

```bash
opik configure
```

This interactive command will guide you through setting up the required configuration.

Otherwise, please double-check your existing configuration:

For Opik Cloud by Comet:

- `api_key` (required): Verify your API key is correct and active
- `workspace` (required): Confirm you have access to the specified workspace
- `project_name` (optional): If specified, ensure the project name is valid
- `url_override`: Should be set to `https://www.comet.com/opik/api` (this is the default)

For Self-hosted Opik:

- `url_override` (required): Verify your base URL points to your Opik instance (e.g., `http://your-instance:5173/api`)

You can find your current configuration in the Opik configuration file (`~/.opik.config`) or by checking your environment variables (`OPIK_API_KEY`, `OPIK_WORKSPACE`, `OPIK_URL_OVERRIDE`, `OPIK_PROJECT_NAME`). For more details on configuration, see our [SDK Configuration guide](/docs/opik/tracing/sdk_configuration).

## How can I diagnose issues with Opik?

If you are experiencing any problems using Opik, such as receiving 400 or 500 errors from the backend, or being unable to connect at all, we recommend running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
opik healthcheck
```

This command will analyze your configuration and backend connectivity, providing useful insights into potential issues.
