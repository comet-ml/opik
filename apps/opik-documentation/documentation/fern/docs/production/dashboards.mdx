<Note>
  Dashboards are currently in Beta. The feature is fully functional but may
  receive updates based on user feedback. We are actively working on expanding
  dashboard capabilities and will be adding new features in the near future.
</Note>

If you have any feedback or feature requests for dashboards, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/issues).

## Accessing dashboards

Dashboards are available in three locations within Opik:

1. **Dashboards page**: Access the standalone dashboards page from the sidebar navigation to create and manage all your dashboards.

2. **Project page**: Switch to the Dashboards tab within any project to view metrics specific to that project's traces and threads.

3. **Experiment page**: When comparing experiments, use the Dashboards tab to visualize feedback scores across different experiment runs.

## Dashboard templates

Opik provides pre-built templates to help you get started quickly:

### Experiments metrics widget

Compares feedback scores across multiple experiments. Ideal for visualizing A/B test results and prompt iteration outcomes. Supports multiple chart types and flexible data selection methods.

**Chart types:**

- **Line chart** - Show trends across experiments (default)
- **Bar chart** - View detailed score distributions side by side - ideal for precise comparisons
- **Radar chart** - Compare multiple feedback scores across experiments in a radial view - great for seeing overall performance patterns

**Data selection methods:**

- **Filter and group**: Dynamically filter and aggregate experiment results. You can:

  - Filter by dataset (e.g., only experiments from a specific dataset)
  - Filter by configuration metadata (e.g., model="gpt-4", temperature="0.7")
  - Group by dataset to compare results across different datasets
  - Group by configuration keys (e.g., group by model or prompt version) to aggregate feedback scores - supports up to 5 grouping levels for hierarchical comparisons
  - Best for: creating dashboards that automatically include new experiments matching your criteria

- **Select experiments**: Manually select specific experiments to compare (up to 10 at a time). When creating widgets from the Experiment page (Compare experiments view), you can use this mode to visualize the experiments you're currently comparing. Best for:
  - Comparing specific experiment runs you want to highlight
  - A/B testing with a fixed set of experiments
  - Creating focused comparisons for presentations or reports

**Configuration options:**

- **Data source**: Choose between "Filter and group" or "Select experiments" mode
- **Filters** (Filter and group mode only): Filter experiments by:
  - Dataset - show only experiments from a specific dataset
  - Configuration - filter by metadata keys and values (e.g., model="gpt-4")
- **Groups** (Filter and group mode only): Group aggregated results by:
  - Dataset - compare results across different datasets
  - Configuration - group by metadata keys to aggregate feedback scores (e.g., group by model type)
- **Experiments** (Select experiments mode only): Manually select specific experiments from your list (limited to 10 experiments)
- **Chart type**: Choose line, bar, or radar chart visualization
- **Metrics**: Optionally display only specific feedback scores (leave empty to show all)

2. Click **Create new dashboard**
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. Select a template to start from, or begin with a blank dashboard
5. Click **Create**

### From the Dashboards tab

When viewing a project or comparing experiments:

1. Switch to the **Dashboards** tab
2. Use the dropdown to select an existing dashboard or create a new one
3. New dashboards inherit the current project or experiment context

## Customizing dashboards

### Adding sections

Dashboards are organized into sections, each containing one or more widgets:

1. Click **Add section** at the bottom of the dashboard
2. Give the section a title
3. Add widgets to the section

### Adding widgets

1. Click the **+** button within a section
2. Select the widget type from the available options
3. Configure the widget settings:
   - Title and subtitle
   - Metric type (for metrics widgets)

Click on a section title to collapse or expand it. The collapsed state is preserved across sessions.

## Date range filtering

Project-based widgets respect the global date range filter:

1. Use the date picker in the dashboard toolbar
2. Select a preset range (Last 24 hours, Last 7 days, etc.) or choose custom dates
3. Applicable widgets automatically update to show data within the selected range

**Widgets that use date range filtering:**

- Project metrics widget - filters time-series data to the selected range
- Project statistics widget - calculates statistics within the selected range

**Widgets not affected by date range:**

- Experiments metrics widget - displays experiment results regardless of date
- Markdown text widget - static content

## Saving changes

Dashboards auto-detect changes. When you make modifications:

1. The **Save** and **Discard** buttons appear in the toolbar
2. Click **Save** to persist your changes
3. Click **Discard** to revert to the last saved state

<Warning>
  Unsaved changes will be lost if you navigate away. A confirmation dialog will
  appear if you try to leave with unsaved changes.
</Warning>

## Sharing dashboards

To share your current dashboard view:

1. Click the **Share** button in the toolbar
2. The URL is copied to your clipboard
3. Share this URL with team members who have access to the workspace

The shared URL includes the dashboard ID and any active filters, so recipients see the same view.

## Working with templates

### Using a template

Templates provide a starting point for common monitoring scenarios:

1. When creating a new dashboard, select a template
2. The dashboard is populated with pre-configured sections and widgets
3. Customize as needed for your specific use case

### Saving as a new dashboard

If you've customized a template and want to save it:

1. Make your modifications to the template view
2. Click **Save as new dashboard**
3. Enter a name for your new dashboard
4. The dashboard is saved to your workspace and can be accessed from the Dashboards page
