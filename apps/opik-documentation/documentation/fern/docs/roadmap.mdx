Opik is [Open-Source](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik) and is under very active development. We use the feedback from the Opik community to drive the roadmap, this is very much a living document that will change as we release new features and learn about new ways to improve the product.

<Tip>
If you have any ideas or suggestions for the roadmap, you can create a [new Feature Request issue](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/issues/new/choose) in the Opik Github repo.
