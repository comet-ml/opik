title: Platform Architecture
---

Opik's architecture consists of multiple services that each handle a specific role, including:

- **A backend service**: Java + Dropwizard.
- **A frontend application**: TypeScript + React, served by Nginx.
- **Data stores**:
  - ClickHouse for large-scale data ingestion and fast queries (e.g., for traces or experiments).
    - With Zookeeper to coordinate the cluster.
    - With an Operator to provide operational and performance metrics.
  - MySQL for transactional data.
  - Redis for caching, rate limiting, distributed locks and streams.

## Backend Service

Opik's backend uses Java 21 LTS and Dropwizard 4, structured as a RESTful web service offering public API
endpoints for core functionality. Full API documentation is available [here](/reference/rest-api/overview).

For observability Opik uses OpenTelemetry due its vendor-neutral approach and wide support across languages
and frameworks. It provides a single, consistent way to collect telemetry data from all services and applications.

_You can find the full backend codebase in Github under the [`apps/opik-backend`](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/tree/main/apps/opik-backend) folder._

## Frontend Application

Opik's frontend is a TypeScript + React application served by Nginx. It provides a user-friendly interface for
interacting with the backend services. The frontend is built using a modular approach, with each module
encapsulating a specific feature or functionality.

_You can find the full frontend codebase in Github under the [`apps/opik-frontend`](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/tree/main/apps/opik-frontend) folder._

## SDK's

Opik provides SDKs for Python, and JavaScript. These SDKs allow developers to interact with Opik's backend
services programmatically. The SDKs are designed to be easy to use and provide a high-level abstraction over
the REST API and many additional features.

_You can find the full SDK codebase in Github under the [`sdks/python`](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/tree/main/sdks/python) for the Python SDK
and [`sdks/typescript`](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/tree/main/sdks/typescript) for the TypeScript SDK._

## ClickHouse

ClickHouse is a column-oriented database management system developed by Yandex. It is optimized for fast analytics on large datasets and is capable of processing hundreds of millions to more than a billion rows and tens of gigabytes of data per single server per second.

Opik uses ClickHouse for datasets that require near real-time ingestion and analytical queries, such as:

- LLM calls and traces
- Feedback scores
- Datasets and experiments
- Experiments

## MySQL

Opik uses MySQL for transactional data, it provides ACID-compliant transactional storage for Opik's lower-volume but critical data, such as:

- Feedback definitions
- Metadata containers e.g., projects that group related traces
- Configuration data

## Redis

Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports a vast range of data structures. Opik uses Redis for:

- A distributed cache: for high-speed lookups.
- A distributed lock: for coordinating safe access to certain shared resources.
- A rate limiter: to enforce throughput limits and protect scalability.
- A streaming mechanism: Redis streams power Opik's Online evaluation functionality; future iterations may integrate Kafka or similar platforms for even higher scalability.

## Observability

Opik is built and runs on top of open-source infrastructure (MySQL, Redis, Kubernetes, and more), making it straightforward to integrate with popular observability stacks such as Grafana and Prometheus. Specifically:

- The backend uses OpenTelemetry for vendor-neutral instrumentation.
- ClickHouse deployments include an operator for real-time performance monitoring and metric exports to Grafana/Prometheus.
- Other components (MySQL, Redis, Kubernetes) also have well-documented strategies for monitoring.
