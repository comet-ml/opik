## 🖥️ UX improvements

- We’ve redesigned the **Opik Home Page** to deliver a cleaner, more intuitive first-use experience, with a focused value proposition, direct access to key metrics, and a polished look. The demo data has also been upgraded to showcase Opik’s capabilities more effectively for new users. Additionally, we've added **inter-project comparison capabilities** for metrics and cost control, allowing you to benchmark and monitor performance and expenses across multiple projects.
