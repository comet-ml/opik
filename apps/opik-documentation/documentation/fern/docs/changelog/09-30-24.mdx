**Opik Dashboard**:

- Added option to delete experiments from the UI
- Updated empty state for projects with no traces
- Removed tooltip delay for the reason icon in the feedback score components

**SDK:**

- Introduced new `get_or_create_dataset` method to the `opik.Opik` client. This method will create a new dataset if it does not exist.
- When inserting items into a dataset, duplicate items are now silently ignored instead of being ingested.
