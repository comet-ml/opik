Here are the most relevant improvements we've made since the last release:

## üö® Alerts
We've launched **Alerts** ‚Äî a powerful way to get automated webhook notifications from your Opik workspace whenever important events happen (errors, feedback scores, prompt changes, and more). Opik now sends an HTTP POST to your endpoint with rich, structured event data you can route anywhere.

Now, you can make Opik a seamless part of your end-to-end workflows! With the new Alerts you can:
- **Spot production errors** in near-real time
- **Track feedback scores** to monitor model quality and user satisfaction
- **Audit prompt changes** across your workspace
- **Funnel events** into your existing workflows and CI/CD pipelines

And this is just v1.0! We'll keep adding events and advanced filtering, thresholds and more fine-grained control in future iterations, always based on community feedback.

## üñºÔ∏è Expanded Multimodal Image Support

We've added a better image support across our platform!

### What's new?

**1. Image Support in LLM as a Judge online Evaluations** - LLM as a Judge evaluations now support images alongside text, enabling you to evaluate vision models and multimodal applications. Upload images and get comprehensive feedback on both text and visual content.

**2. Enhanced Playground Experience** - The playground now supports image inputs, allowing you to test prompts with images before running full evaluations. Perfect for experimenting with vision models and multimodal prompts.

**3. Improved Data Display** - Base64 image previews in data tables, better image handling in trace views, and enhanced pretty formatting for multimodal content.
