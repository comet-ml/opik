**Opik Dashboard**:

- Added a new `Feedback modal` in the UI so you can easily provide feedback on any parts of the platform.

**SDK**:

- Released new evaluation metric: [GEval](/evaluation/metrics/g_eval) - This LLM as a Judge metric is task agnostic and can be used to evaluate any LLM call based on your own custom evaluation criteria.
- Allow users to specify the path to the Opik configuration file using the `OPIK_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable, read more about it in the [Python SDK Configuration guide](/tracing/sdk_configuration#using-a-configuration-file).
- You can now configure the `project_name` as part of the `evaluate` method so that traces are logged to a specific project instead of the default one.
- Added a new `Opik.search_traces` method to search for traces, this includes support for a search string to return only specific traces.
- Enforce structured outputs for LLM as a Judge metrics so that they are more reliable (they will no longer fail when decoding the LLM response).
