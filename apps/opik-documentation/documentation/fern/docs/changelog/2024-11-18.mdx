**Opik Dashboard**:

- Updated the majority of tables to increase the information density, it is now easier to review many traces at once.
- Images logged to datasets and experiments are now displayed in the UI. Both images urls and base64 encoded images are supported.

**SDK**:

- The `scoring_metrics` argument is now optional in the `evaluate` method. This is useful if you are looking at evaluating your LLM calls manually in the Opik UI.
- When uploading a dataset, the SDK now prints a link to the dataset in the UI.
- Usage is now correctly logged when using the LangChain OpenAI integration.
- Implement a batching mechanism for uploading spans and dataset items to avoid `413 Request Entity Too Large` errors.
- Removed pandas and numpy as mandatory dependencies.
