Here are the most relevant improvements we've made since the last release:

## 🛠️ SDK Improvements

We've significantly expanded the capabilities of both our Python and TypeScript SDKs, making it easier to integrate Opik into your workflows programmatically.

**What's new:**

- **Annotation Queue Support** - Both Python and TypeScript SDKs now support annotation queues, allowing you to programmatically manage and interact with your annotation workflows
- **Dataset Versioning** - Full dataset versioning support is now available in both SDKs, giving you better control over your data lifecycle and experiment reproducibility
- **Dataset Filtering (TypeScript)** - Filter dataset items directly from the TypeScript SDK for more efficient data retrieval
- **Opik Query Language (TypeScript)** - The TypeScript SDK now supports Opik Query Language (OQL), enabling powerful and flexible querying of your data
- **Feedback Scores Logging (TypeScript)** - Log feedback scores directly from the TypeScript SDK to track model quality metrics
- **Thread Search (TypeScript)** - Search through conversation threads programmatically with the new `searchThreads` functionality
