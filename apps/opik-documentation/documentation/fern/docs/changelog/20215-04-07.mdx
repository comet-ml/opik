**Opik Dashboard:**

- Added search to codeblocks in the input and output fields

**Python and JS / TS SDK**:

- Cleanup up usage information by removing it from metadata field if it's already
  part of the `Usage` field.
- Added support for `Rouge` metric - Thanks @rohithmsr !
- Updated the LangChain callback `OpikTracer()` to log the data in a structured
  way rather than as raw text. This is expecially useful when using LangGraph.
- Updated the LangChainJS integration with additional examples and small fixes.
- Updated the OpenAI integration to support the Responses API.
