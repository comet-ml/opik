Here are the most relevant improvements we've made since the last release:

## 🚀 Optimization Studio

We're excited to introduce **Optimization Studio** — a powerful new way to improve your prompts without writing code. Bring a prompt, define what "good" looks like, and Opik tests variations to find a better version you can ship with confidence.

**What's new:**

- **No-code prompt optimization** - Optimization Studio helps you improve prompts directly from the Opik UI. You see scores and examples, not just a hunch, shortening the loop from idea to evidence
- **Algorithm selection** - Choose how Opik searches for better prompts: **GEPA** works well for single-turn prompts and quick improvements, while **HRPO** is better when you need deeper analysis of why a prompt fails
- **Flexible metrics** - Define how Opik should score each prompt variation. Use **Equals** for strict matching when you have a single correct answer, or **G-Eval** when answers can vary and you want a model to grade quality
- **Visual progress tracking** - Monitor your optimization runs with real-time progress charts showing the best score so far and results for each trial
- **Trials comparison** - The Trials tab lets you compare prompt variations and scores side-by-side, with the ability to drill down into individual evaluated items
- **Rerun & compare** - Easily rerun the same setup, cancel a run to change inputs, or select multiple runs to compare outcomes

For teams that prefer a programmatic workflow, we've also released **Opik Optimizer SDK v3** with improved algorithms, better performance, and more intuitive APIs.

**What's new:**

- **Experiment Leaderboard Widget** - A new leaderboard widget lets you rank and compare experiments at a glance directly from your dashboard, making it easier to identify your best-performing configurations
- **Group By for Metrics Widget** - The project metrics widget now supports grouping, allowing you to slice and dice your metrics data in more meaningful ways
- **Span-level Metrics Charts** - New charts provide visibility into span-level metrics, giving you deeper insights into the performance of individual components in your traces

## 🎬 Video Generation Support

We've added support for the latest video generation models, enabling you to track and log video outputs from your AI applications.

**What's new:**

- **OpenAI SORA Integration** - Log and track video generation outputs from OpenAI's SORA model directly in Opik
- **Google Veo Integration** - Full support for Google's Veo video generation API, including automatic logging of video outputs and metadata

## 🧪 Experiment Management

We've made it easier to organize and navigate your experiments with new filtering and tagging capabilities.

**What's improved:**

- **Project Column in Experiments View** - Experiments now display their associated project directly in the list view, making it easier to understand context at a glance
- **Project Filter & Grouping** - Filter and group your experiments by project to quickly find what you're looking for across large experiment collections
- **Experiment Tags** - Tags are now rendered on the experiment page, helping you categorize and identify experiments more easily

## ✨ UI/UX Improvements

We've made several improvements to make your day-to-day workflow smoother.

**What's improved:**

- **Time Formatting Settings** - Customize how timestamps are displayed throughout the UI to match your preferred format
- **Online Score Rules Defaults** - Input and output fields in online score rules are now pre-populated with sensible defaults, reducing setup time
- **Dataset Item Navigation** - Navigation tags in the experiment item view now link directly to the associated dataset item for easier data exploration
- **Annotation Queue Review** - You can now review completed annotation queues, making it easier to audit and verify your annotation work

## 🔌 SDK & Integrations

We've improved our SDK integrations with better tracing and performance metrics.

**What's improved:**

- **Vercel AI SDK Thread Support** - Thread ID support for the Vercel AI SDK integration enables better conversation tracking across multi-turn interactions
- **ADK Distributed Tracing** - Added distributed trace headers support to the ADK integration for improved observability in distributed systems
- **Time-to-First-Token (TTFT)** - The ADK integration now captures TTFT metrics, giving you visibility into response latency for streaming applications
