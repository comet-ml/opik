Here are the most relevant improvements we've made since the last release:

## 🚀 Optimization Studio Enhancements

We've significantly improved the Optimization Studio experience with better performance, visibility, and control over your optimization workflows.

**What's new:**

- **Parallel job processing** - Optimization jobs now run in parallel, dramatically reducing wait times for large optimization tasks
- **Cancel execution** - Added the ability to cancel running optimization jobs directly from the UI, giving you full control over long-running processes
- **Log viewer** - New log viewer provides real-time visibility into optimization job execution, making it easier to debug and monitor progress
- **Enhanced log streaming** - Optimization logs now stream to Redis and sync to S3, ensuring you never lose important execution details

These improvements make the Optimization Studio more reliable and easier to use for complex optimization workflows.

## 🏷️ Annotation Queue Improvements

We've made annotation workflows smoother and more efficient with better navigation and feedback management.

**Key enhancements:**

- **Navigation tags** - Added navigation tags that let you jump directly from annotation queues to related traces and threads, making it easier to review context
- **Select all feedback scores** - New "Select all" option for feedback scores in annotation queues, speeding up bulk annotation tasks

These updates streamline the annotation process, helping teams annotate data faster and more accurately.

## 📊 Dataset Versioning & Management

We've enhanced dataset versioning capabilities to give you better control over your data lifecycle and experiment tracking.

**What's improved:**

- **Dataset version selection** - Easily select and manage dataset versions directly in the UI, with support for linking versions to experiments
- **Experiment-dataset linking** - Dataset versions can now be linked to experiments, providing clear traceability from data to results
- **Draft state support** - Frontend now supports draft states for dataset versions, allowing you to work on versions before publishing
- **User-friendly versioning** - Improved UI makes it easier to understand and manage dataset versions

These changes make it simpler to track which data was used in which experiments, improving reproducibility and data governance.

## 🎨 Prompt Management Enhancements

We've added several improvements to make prompt editing and management more powerful and intuitive.

**New capabilities:**

- **Model selector for OpikAI features** - The Prompt Generator and Prompt Improver now include a model selector, giving you more flexibility in how prompts are generated and improved
- **Pretty & raw views** - Text prompt pages now support both pretty and raw views, making it easier to read formatted prompts or see the exact raw content
- **Visual prompt validation** - Chat prompts now show visual indicators when they're invalid, helping you catch errors before running prompts

These enhancements make the prompt management experience more polished and user-friendly.

## 🔍 Traces & Spans Navigation

We've improved navigation between trace views to make it faster to explore your trace data.

- **Trace tree to spans table shortcut** - New navigation shortcut lets you jump directly from the trace tree view to the spans table, streamlining your workflow when analyzing trace hierarchies

## 🎮 Playground Improvements

The Playground now provides more visibility into evaluation results.

- **Metric results in output cell** - Metric evaluation results now appear directly in the playground output cell, giving you immediate feedback on prompt performance without leaving the playground

## 🧪 Experiment Enhancements

We've added more filtering capabilities for experiments.

- **Experiment and project filtering** - Experiments now support filtering by experiment ID and project ID, making it easier to find and organize your experiments

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

We've made several UI refinements to improve consistency and usability.

- **Colored tags mapping** - Updated the colored tags mapping for resources to provide better visual organization
- **Model defaults** - Updated model defaults across the platform for better consistency

## 📦 SDK Updates

We've made several improvements to the Python SDK to make it more reliable and easier to use.

**What's improved:**

- **LLM metrics tracking** - Fixed inconsistent track parameter handling for LLM metrics, ensuring more accurate tracking
- **Feedback score methods** - Enhanced `log_*_feedback_scores` methods with better API design and error handling
- **Harbor integration** - Fixed issue where Harbor integration was showing hardcoded task names instead of actual task names in trace Name columns

## 🔌 Integration Updates

- **OpenAI default selection** - Improved logic for default model selection, avoiding OpenAI selection when fine-tuning is disabled

## 📈 Evaluation & Metrics

We've improved how metrics are displayed and calculated.

- **Unique timestamp metrics** - Metrics now show results based on unique timestamps rather than just the first line, providing more accurate metric calculations
