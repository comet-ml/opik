Here are the most relevant improvements we've made since the last release:

## 🔍 Opik Trace Analyzer Beta is Live! 
We're excited to announce the launch of **Opik Trace Analyzer** on Opik Cloud!

What this means: faster debugging & analysis! 

Our users can now easily understand, analyze, and debug their development and production traces. 

Want to give it a try? All you need to do is go to one of your traces and click on "Inspect trace" to start getting valuable insights.
