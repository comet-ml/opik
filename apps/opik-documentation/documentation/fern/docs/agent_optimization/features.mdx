Choosing the right optimizer is easier when you can see which capabilities are covered. The table
below highlights the primary features that customers ask about most often—prompt inputs, agent
interfaces, tool optimization, and multimodal awareness.

| Optimizer | ChatPrompt Input | OptimizableAgent Support | Function or Tool Use¹ | MCP Tool Use | Prompt Optimization | Tool Signature Optimization² | MCP Optimization | Multimodal Input³ |

**Legend**

- ✅ — Supported out of the box
- ⚠️ — Works, but requires manual configuration (e.g., set `max_tokens` yourself)
- ❌ — Not supported today

<Info>
¹ Every optimizer built on `ChatPrompt` can optimize prompts that make function calls or invoke tool
sandboxes. This is different from optimizing tool *schemas*.
</Info>

<Info>
² Tool signature optimization (editing tool descriptions, arguments, or MCP manifests) is currently
available only through the MetaPrompt optimizer as documented in
[Tool Optimization (MCP & Functions)](/agent_optimization/algorithms/tool_optimization). Other
optimizers can still optimize prompts that *use* tools.
</Info>

<Info>
³ Every optimizer keeps multimodal structure intact. You may still need to set conservative `max_tokens` /
`max_completion_tokens` manually when working with large attachments.
