description: "See which Opik Agent Optimizer algorithms cover ChatPrompt inputs, agents, tool use, MCP workflows, and multimodal content."

Choosing the right optimizer is easier when you can see which capabilities are covered. This page
is an Explanation/Reference matrix that compares each optimizer’s supported features when run inside
the Opik Optimizer SDK (some capabilities, like MCP integration and tool signature editing, are provided by the Opik
framework itself). Start by finding the algorithm you’re evaluating, then scan across to confirm it meets your ChatPrompt,
tool, MCP, and multimodal requirements before reading the detailed algorithm pages.

<Callout>
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Use the “Function or Tool Use” column for standard function-calling agents, the “MCP Tool Use” column when you need MCP-specific flows, and “MCP Optimization” when you
  want the optimizer to change tool signatures.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="¹ Function vs. Tool Optimization">
    Every optimizer built on `ChatPrompt` can work with prompts that make function calls or invoke tool sandboxes.
    This is different from optimizing the tool schemas themselves.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="² Tool Signature Optimization">
    Editing tool descriptions, arguments, or MCP manifests is currently only available via the MetaPrompt optimizer (see
    [Tool Optimization (MCP & Functions)](/agent_optimization/algorithms/tool_optimization)). Other optimizers can still optimize prompts that reference tools without changing the tool definition.
