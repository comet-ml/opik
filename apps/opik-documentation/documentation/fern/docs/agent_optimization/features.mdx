Choosing the right optimizer is easier when you can see which capabilities are supported. This page
is an Explanation/Reference matrix for the Opik Optimizer SDK; some capabilities (like MCP integration or tool signature editing)
are provided by the SDK and surfaced only through certain algorithms.

Use this table by scanning down the feature list and reading across to confirm which algorithm satisfies your Chat Prompt, agent,
tool, MCP, and multimodal requirements before diving into the detailed algorithm docs.

| Feature | Evolutionary | Few Shot | GEPA | Hierarchical | MetaPrompt | Parameter |

| Chat Prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Use Agent Frameworks | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Function or Tool Use¹ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| MCP Tool Use | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Prompt Editing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | n/a |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="¹ Function vs. Tool Optimization">
    Every optimizer built on `ChatPrompt` can work with prompts that make function calls or invoke tool sandboxes.
    This is different from optimizing the tool schemas themselves.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="² Tool Signature Optimization">
    Editing tool descriptions, arguments, or MCP manifests is currently only available via the MetaPrompt optimizer (see
    [Tool Optimization (MCP & Functions)](/agent_optimization/algorithms/tool_optimization)). Other optimizers can still optimize prompts that reference tools without changing the tool definition.
