Choosing the right optimizer is easier when you can see which capabilities are covered. The table
below highlights the primary features that customers ask about most often—prompt inputs, agent
interfaces, tool optimization, and multimodal awareness.

| Optimizer | ChatPrompt Input | OptimizableAgent Support | Function or Tool Use¹ | Prompt Optimization | Tool Signature Optimization² | MCP Tool Optimization (Beta) | Multimodal Handling³ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Hierarchical Reflective** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ Structure guardrails; manual token caps |
| **MetaPrompt** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ Structure guardrails; manual token caps |
| **Evolutionary** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Auto context budgeting + structure guardrails |

| **Parameter** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ LLM parameter search only | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ Structure guardrails; manual token caps |

**Legend**

- ✅ — Supported out of the box
- ⚠️ — Works, but requires manual configuration (e.g., set `max_tokens` yourself)
- ❌ — Not supported today

<Info>
¹ Every optimizer built on `ChatPrompt` can optimize prompts that make function calls or invoke tool
sandboxes. This is different from optimizing tool *schemas*.
</Info>

<Info>
² Tool signature optimization (editing tool descriptions, arguments, or MCP manifests) is currently
available only through the MetaPrompt optimizer as documented in
[Tool Optimization (MCP & Functions)](/agent_optimization/algorithms/tool_optimization). Other
optimizers can still optimize prompts that *use* tools.
</Info>

<Info>
³ All optimizers accept multimodal `ChatPrompt` content and now share the same structure-preservation
guardrails so attachments (image/video/audio/file parts) aren’t dropped during edits. The Evolutionary optimizer also
auto-budgets tokens for large attachments; every other optimizer still requires you to set conservative
`model_parameters` (e.g., `max_tokens`/`max_completion_tokens`) manually.
