title: Agent & Prompt Optimization Overview with Opik
---
**Prompt engineering** is the practice of designing and refining prompts to help
LLMs generate the desired output. Typically prompt engineering is a manual process
that involves editing the prompt, evaluating it, reviewing the results and
trying again.

**Prompt optimization** is the process of automating the prompt engineering process.

<Warning>
  The Agent Optimization toolkit, including the optimizers described below, is currently in **Public Beta**. We are actively working on improving these features and welcome your [feedback on GitHub](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/issues)!

## Why optimize prompts ?

Prompt engineering is a skill that can be difficult to master as highlighted by
the [Anthropic ](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview#how-to-prompt-engineer),
[OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api)
and [Google](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering) prompt
engineering guides. There are a lot of techniques that can be used to help
LLMs generate the desired output.

Prompt optimization solves many of the issues that come with prompt engineering:

1. Prompt engineering is not easily repeatable or scalable alone
2. Variations across models could lead to performance degration, you need to
   tune prompts for each model
3. Optimization may unlock performance, cost and reliability improvements
4. As systems evolve to be more interdependent, manually tuning multiple prompts
   becomes increasingly difficult.

<br />
So when should you use prompt optimization?

## Optimization Algorithms

### Supported algorithms

The [Opik Optimizer](https://pypi.org/project/opik-optimizer/) is an
experimental Python library that aims at implementing Prompt and Agent
Optimization algorithms in a consistent format.

<Note>
  All Opik optimizers leverage **LiteLLM** for broad model compatibility. This means you can use models from OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, Google, local Ollama instances, and many more. For details on how to specify different models, see the [LiteLLM Support for Optimizers](/agent_optimization/opik_optimizer/litellm_support) guide.
</Note>

The following algorithms have been implemented:

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MetaPrompt Optimization           | Uses an LLM ("reasoning model") to critique and iteratively refine an initial instruction prompt. Good for general prompt wording, clarity, and structural improvements.                                                                 | [MetaPrompt Optimization](/agent_optimization/algorithms/metaprompt_optimizer)              |
| Few-shot Bayesian Optimization    | Specifically for chat models, this optimizer uses Bayesian optimization (Optuna) to find the optimal number and combination of few-shot examples (demonstrations) to accompany a system prompt.                                                 | [Few-shot Bayesian Optimization](/agent_optimization/algorithms/fewshot_bayesian_optimizer) |
| MIPRO Optimization                | A prompt engineering algorithm that uses a MIPRO (Multi-Instance Prompt Refinement) approach to generate a set of candidate prompts and then uses a Bayesian optimization algorithm to identify the best prompt.                                                 | [MIPRO Optimization](/agent_optimization/algorithms/mipro_optimizer)                        |
| Evolutionary Optimization         | Employs genetic algorithms to evolve a population of prompts. Can discover novel prompt structures and supports multi-objective optimization (e.g., score vs. length). Can use LLMs for advanced mutation/crossover.                          | [Evolutionary Optimization](/agent_optimization/algorithms/evolutionary_optimizer)          |

## Choosing the Right Optimizer & Example Use Cases

Selecting the most appropriate optimizer depends heavily on your specific task and what aspect of your LLM application you're trying to improve.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 1: Improving a General Instruction Prompt">
    **Goal:** You have a single instruction prompt for a task (e.g., summarization, classification, general question answering) and you want to improve its clarity, effectiveness, or how well it guides the LLM.
    
    **Recommended Optimizer(s):**
    - **[`MetaPromptOptimizer`](/agent_optimization/algorithms/metaprompt_optimizer):** Ideal for this. It uses an LLM to suggest and evaluate changes to your existing prompt text.
    - **[`EvolutionaryOptimizer`](/agent_optimization/algorithms/evolutionary_optimizer):** Can also be used if you want to explore a wider range of structural changes or have multiple objectives like also minimizing prompt length.

    **Example:** Your current summarization prompt sometimes produces summaries that are too verbose. You could use `MetaPromptOptimizer` to refine it for conciseness and accuracy, or `EvolutionaryOptimizer` to explicitly optimize for both a summarization quality metric and shorter prompt length.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 2: Optimizing Few-Shot Examples for a Chatbot">
    **Goal:** Your chatbot's performance relies heavily on providing good few-shot examples (user/assistant turn pairs) in the initial system message to guide its responses, and you want to find the best set of examples from a larger pool.

    **Recommended Optimizer(s):**
    - **[`FewShotBayesianOptimizer`](/agent_optimization/algorithms/fewshot_bayesian_optimizer):** Specifically designed for this. It will test different numbers and combinations of examples from your dataset to find the optimal set for your chat model.

    **Example:** You have a customer service chatbot and a dataset of 100 high-quality past interactions. `FewShotBayesianOptimizer` can help you select the best 3-5 interactions to use as few-shot examples to improve the chatbot's helpfulness and tone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 3: Enhancing a Tool-Using Agent or Complex Reasoning Task">
    **Goal:** You are building an agent that needs to use external tools (e.g., a search engine, a calculator, an API) or perform multi-step reasoning to arrive at an answer. The agent's internal logic and prompts for tool interaction need improvement.

    **Recommended Optimizer(s):**
    - **[`MiproOptimizer`](/agent_optimization/algorithms/mipro_optimizer):** This is the best choice. It uses DSPy's MIPRO algorithm to optimize the entire agent structure, including the prompts that define how the agent reasons and uses tools.

    **Example:** You have a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system where the LLM needs to first generate a good search query, then process the retrieved documents, and finally synthesize an answer. `MiproOptimizer` can help refine the prompts for each of these stages within a DSPy program.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scenario 4: Discovering Novel Prompts or Multi-Objective Needs">
    **Goal:** You want to explore fundamentally different ways of prompting for a task, or you need to balance multiple competing objectives (e.g., maximizing factual accuracy while minimizing response latency, which might correlate with prompt/response length).

    **Recommended Optimizer(s):**
    - **[`EvolutionaryOptimizer`](/agent_optimization/algorithms/evolutionary_optimizer):** Its genetic algorithm approach can explore a wide design space. With `enable_moo=True`, it can handle multi-objective optimization, providing a Pareto front of solutions that offer different trade-offs.

    **Example:** You want to find the shortest possible prompt for an information extraction task that still maintains at least 90% accuracy. `EvolutionaryOptimizer` with multi-objective optimization could help find such prompts.
