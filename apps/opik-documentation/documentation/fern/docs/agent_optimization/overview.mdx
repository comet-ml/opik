**Opik Agent Optimizer** is a turnkey, open-source agent and prompt optimization SDK. It automatically tunes prompts and agent workflows (including tool-using agents) using the datasets, metrics, and traces you already log to Opik. MCP tool schema optimization support is coming soon. Instead of hand-editing instructions and re-running evaluations, pick an optimizer (MetaPrompt, HRPO, Evolutionary, GEPA, etc.) and let it iterate for you online or fully offline inside Docker and Kubernetes.

## Why teams choose Opik Agent Optimizer

- **Automatic prompt optimization** – end-to-end workflow that installs in minutes and runs locally or in your stack.
- **Open-source and framework agnostic** – no lock-in, use Opik’s first-party optimizers or community favorites like GEPA in the same SDK.
- **Agent-aware** – optimize beyond system prompts, including multi-step workflows and tool-using agents. MetaPrompt adds MCP tool schema optimization (beta).
- **Multimodal-ready** – optimize prompts that include text + image/audio/video content parts. See [Optimize multimodal](/agent_optimization/optimization/optimize_multimodal).
- **Deep observability** – every trial logs prompts, tool calls, traces, and metric reasons to Opik so you can explain and ship changes confidently.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Prepare data & metrics">
    Use Opik datasets (CSV upload, API, or trace exports) plus deterministic metrics/`ScoreResult` functions. See [Define datasets](/agent_optimization/optimization/define_datasets) and [Define metrics](/agent_optimization/optimization/define_metrics).
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Pick an optimizer">
    Choose the best algorithm for your task (see [Optimization algorithms](/agent_optimization/algorithms/overview)). All optimizers expose the same API, so you can swap them easily or chain runs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Inspect & ship">
    Results land in the Opik dashboard under **Evaluation → Optimization runs**, where you can compare prompts, failure modes, and dataset coverage before promoting the change.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Optimization Algorithms

The optimizer implements both proprietary and open-source optimization algorithms. Each one has its
strengths and weaknesses, we recommend first trying out either GEPA or HRPO (Hierarchical Reflective Prompt Optimizer)
as a first step:

| **Algorithm**                                                                               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [MetaPrompt Optimization](/agent_optimization/algorithms/metaprompt_optimizer)              | Uses an LLM ("reasoning model") to critique and iteratively refine an initial instruction prompt. Good for general prompt wording, clarity, and structural improvements. **Supports [MCP tool optimization](/agent_optimization/algorithms/tool_optimization) (beta, MetaPrompt-only).** |
| [HRPO (Hierarchical Reflective Prompt Optimizer)](/agent_optimization/algorithms/hierarchical_adaptive_optimizer) | Uses hierarchical root cause analysis to systematically improve prompts by analyzing failures in batches, synthesizing findings, and addressing identified failure modes. Best for complex prompts requiring systematic refinement based on understanding why they fail. |
| [Few-shot Bayesian Optimization](/agent_optimization/algorithms/fewshot_bayesian_optimizer) | Specifically for chat models, this optimizer uses Bayesian optimization (Optuna) to find the optimal number and combination of few-shot examples (demonstrations) to accompany a system prompt.                      |
| [Evolutionary Optimization](/agent_optimization/algorithms/evolutionary_optimizer)          | Employs genetic algorithms to evolve a population of prompts. Can discover novel prompt structures and supports multi-objective optimization (e.g., score vs. length). Can use LLMs for advanced mutation/crossover. |
| [GEPA Optimization](/agent_optimization/algorithms/gepa_optimizer)                   | Wraps the external GEPA package to optimize a single system prompt for single-turn tasks using a reflection model. Requires `pip install gepa`.                                         |
| [Parameter Optimization](/agent_optimization/algorithms/parameter_optimizer)                   | Optimizes LLM call parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.) using Bayesian optimization. Uses Optuna for efficient parameter search with global and local search phases. Best for tuning model behavior without changing the prompt.                                         |
