**Prompt engineering** is the practice of designing and refining prompts to help
LLMs generate the desired output. Typically prompt engineering is a manual process
that involves editing the prompt, evaluating it, reviewing the results and
trying again.

**Prompt optimization** is the process of automating the prompt engineering process.

<Warning>
  The Agent Optimization toolkit, including the optimizers described below, is currently in **Public Beta**. We are actively working on improving these features and welcome your [feedback on GitHub](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/issues)!

## Why optimize prompts ?

Prompt engineering is a skill that can be difficult to master as highlighted by
the [Anthropic ](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview#how-to-prompt-engineer),
[OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api)
and [Google](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering) prompt
engineering guides. There are a lot of techniques that can be used to help
LLMs generate the desired output.

Prompt optimization solves many of the issues that come with prompt engineering:

1. Prompt engineering is not easily repeatable or scalable alone
2. Variations across models could lead to performance degration, you need to
   tune prompts for each model
3. Optimization may unlock performance, cost and reliability improvements
4. As systems evolve to be more interdependent, manually tuning multiple prompts
   becomes increasingly difficult.

So when should you use prompt optimization?

| **Aspect**    | **Prompt Engineering**                              | **Prompt Optimization**                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**     | Broad — includes designing, experimenting, refining | Narrow — improving already existing prompts       |
| **Goal**      | Create a working prompt for a specific task         | Maximize performance (accuracy, efficiency, etc.) |
| **Involves**  | Initial drafting, understanding model behavior      | Tweaking wording, structure, or context           |
| **When used** | Early in task setup or experimentation              | After a baseline prompt is in place               |

## Optimization algorithms

### Supported algorithms

The [Opik Optimizer](https://pypi.org/project/opik-optimizer/) is an
experimental Python library that aims at implementing Prompt and Agent
Optimization algorithms in a consistent format.

<Note>
  All Opik optimizers leverage **LiteLLM** for broad model compatibility. This means you can use models from OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, Google, local Ollama instances, and many more. For details on how to specify different models, see the [LiteLLM Support for Optimizers](/agent_optimization/opik_optimizer/litellm_support) guide.

The following algorithms have been implemented:
