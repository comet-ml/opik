We regularly evaluate every optimizer against shared datasets so you can make informed trade-offs. This page summarizes the latest results and explains how to reproduce them with the public benchmark scripts.

## Datasets & metrics

Each run uses Opik datasets backed by open-source corpuses commonly used in academia:

| Dataset | Description | Primary metrics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arc ([ai2_arc](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/ai2_arc)) | Multiple-choice science questions. | LevenshteinRatio, accuracy. |
| GSM8K ([gsm8k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k)) | Grade-school math word problems. | Exact match, custom math verifier. |
| MedHallu ([medhallu](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UTAustin-AIHealth/MedHallu)) | Medical Q&A with hallucination checks. | Hallucination, AnswerRelevance. |
| RagBench ([ragbench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wandb/ragbench-sentence-relevance-balanced/discussions)) | Retrieval-oriented questions. | AnswerRelevance, contextual grounding. |

Results shown below use `gpt-4o-mini` for evaluation on non multi-hop based runs. Scores will change if you select different models, metrics, agent configurations or prompt seeds.

<Info>
  These are directional numbers. Some optimizers use more LLM/tool calls per trial than others (e.g., the HRPO Hierarchical Reflective Prompt Optimizer batches multiple analyses), so cost and runtime are not apples-to-apples even when the trial budget matches. Re-run the suite with your own datasets, models, and cost constraints before committing to a single optimizer.

## Run benchmarks locally

1. Install dependencies (ideally in a virtualenv):
   ```bash
   pip install -r sdks/opik_optimizer/benchmarks/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Configure provider keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
3. Execute the runner:
   ```bash
   python sdks/opik_optimizer/benchmarks/run_benchmark.py \
     --model openai/gpt-4o-mini \
     --output results.json
   ```
4. Inspect the JSON or load it into a notebook to compare against the published table.

The script spins up datasets defined in `sdks/opik_optimizer/benchmarks/config.py`, runs each optimizer with consistent trial budgets, and logs runs to Opik so you can review traces. Note that production use should include separate validation datasets to prevent overfitting—see [Define datasets](/agent_optimization/optimization/define_datasets) for guidance.

<Tip>
  Looking for production-style examples beyond synthetic benchmarks? Check out the [agent optimizations demos](https://github.com/comet-ml/agent-optimizations-demos) repo. It contains end-to-end scenarios (LangGraph, RAG, support bots) and shows how different optimizers behave in real workloads.
