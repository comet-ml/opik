The MetaPrompter is a specialized optimizer designed for meta-prompt optimization. It focuses on improving the structure and effectiveness of prompts through systematic analysis and refinement of prompt templates, instructions, and examples.

<Note>
  **When to Use This Optimizer:**
  `MetaPromptOptimizer` is a strong choice when you have an initial instruction prompt and want to iteratively refine its wording, structure, and clarity using LLM-driven suggestions. It excels at general-purpose prompt improvement where the core idea of your prompt is sound but could be phrased better for the LLM, or when you want to explore variations suggested by a reasoning model.

**Key Trade-offs:**

- Relies on the quality of the `reasoning_model` for generating good candidates.
- May be less suited than specialized optimizers if your primary goal is _only_ few-shot example selection (see [`FewShotBayesianOptimizer`](/agent_optimization/algorithms/fewshot_bayesian_optimizer)) or _only_ complex agent/tool-use optimization (see [`MiproOptimizer`](/agent_optimization/algorithms/mipro_optimizer)).
- Optimization process involves multiple LLM calls for both reasoning and evaluation, which can impact cost and time.

## How It Works

The `MetaPromptOptimizer` automates the process of prompt refinement by using a "reasoning" LLM to critique and improve your initial prompt. Here's a conceptual breakdown:

1.  **Initial Prompt Evaluation**: Your starting `prompt` messages is first evaluated on the dataset using the specified `metric` to establish a baseline score.

2.  **Reasoning and Candidate Generation**:

    - The optimizer takes your current best prompt and detailed context about the task (derived from `prompt` and `metric`).
    - It then queries a `reasoning_model` (which can be the same as the evaluation `model` or a different, potentially more powerful one). This `reasoning_model` is guided by a system prompt (the "meta-prompt") that instructs it to act as an expert prompt engineer.
    - The `reasoning_model` analyzes the provided prompt and task context, then generates a set of new candidate prompts. Each candidate is designed to improve upon the previous best, with specific reasoning for the suggested changes (e.g., "added more specific constraints," "rephrased for clarity").

3.  **Candidate Evaluation**:

    - These newly generated candidate prompts are then evaluated on the dataset.
    - The optimizer uses an adaptive trial strategy: promising candidates (based on initial trials) may receive more evaluation trials up to `max_trials_per_candidate`.

4.  **Selection and Iteration**:

    - The best-performing candidate from the current round becomes the new "current best prompt."
    - This process repeats for a configured number of `max_rounds` or until the improvement in score falls below `improvement_threshold`.

5.  **Result**: The highest-scoring prompt found throughout all rounds is returned as the optimized prompt.

This iterative loop of generation, evaluation, and selection allows the `MetaPromptOptimizer` to explore different phrasings and structures, guided by the reasoning capabilities of an LLM.

<Tip>
  The evaluation of each candidate prompt (Step 3) uses the `metric` you provide and runs against the `dataset`. This
  process is fundamental to how the optimizer determines which prompts are better. For a deeper understanding of Opik's
  evaluation capabilities, refer to: - [Evaluation Overview](/evaluation/overview) - [Evaluate
  Prompts](/evaluation/evaluate_prompt) - [Metrics Overview](/evaluation/metrics/overview)

## Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration

```python
from opik_optimizer import MetaPromptOptimizer

prompter = MetaPromptOptimizer(
    model="openai/gpt-4",  # or "azure/gpt-4"
    # LLM parameters like temperature, max_tokens are passed as keyword arguments
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=5000,
    # Optimizer-specific parameters
    reasoning_model="openai/gpt-4-turbo", # Optional: model for generating prompt suggestions
    max_rounds=3,
    num_prompts_per_round=4,
    n_threads=8,
    seed=42 # Seed for LLM calls if supported by the model
)
```

### Advanced Configuration

The `MetaPromptOptimizer` primarily uses the constructor parameters listed above for its configuration.
Key parameters include:

- `model`: The LLM used for evaluating generated prompts.
- `reasoning_model`: (Optional) A separate, potentially more powerful LLM used by the optimizer to analyze and generate new prompt candidates. If not provided, `model` is used.
- `max_rounds`: The number of optimization iterations.
- `num_prompts_per_round`: How many new prompt candidates are generated in each round.
- `initial_trials_per_candidate` / `max_trials_per_candidate`: Control the number of evaluations for each candidate.

Additional LLM call parameters (e.g., `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`) for both the evaluation model and the reasoning model can be passed as keyword arguments (`**model_kwargs`) to the constructor. These will be used when making calls to the respective LLMs.

The optimizer works by iteratively generating new prompt suggestions using its `reasoning_model` based on the performance of previous prompts and then evaluating these suggestions.

## Example Usage

```python
from opik_optimizer import MetaPromptOptimizer
from opik.evaluation.metrics import LevenshteinRatio
from opik_optimizer import datasets, ChatPrompt

# Initialize optimizer
optimizer = MetaPromptOptimizer(
    model="openai/gpt-4",  # or "azure/gpt-4"
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=5000,
    n_threads=8,
    seed=42
)

# Prepare dataset
dataset = datasets.hotpot_300()

# Define metric and task configuration (see docs for more options)
def levenshtein_ratio(dataset_item, llm_output):
    return LevenshteinRatio().score(reference=dataset_item['answer'], output=llm_output)

prompt = ChatPrompt(
    project_name="my-project",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Provide an answer to the question."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "{question}"}
    ]
)

# Run optimization
results = optimizer.optimize_prompt(
    prompt=prompt,
    dataset=dataset,
    metric=levenshtein_ratio,
    n_samples=100
)

# Access results
results.display()
```

## Model Support

The MetaPrompter supports all models available through LiteLLM. This provides broad compatibility
with providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and many others, including locally
hosted models.

For detailed instructions on how to specify different models and configure providers, please refer
to the main [LiteLLM Support for Optimizers documentation page](/agent_optimization/opik_optimizer/litellm_support).

### Configuration Example using LiteLLM model string

```python
optimizer = MetaPromptOptimizer(
    model="google/gemini-pro",  # or any LiteLLM supported model
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=5000
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Template Design**

   - Start with clear structure
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Include placeholders for variables

2. **Instruction Writing**

   - Be specific and clear
   - Use active voice
   - Include success criteria

3. **Example Selection**

   - Choose diverse examples
   - Ensure relevance to task
   - Balance complexity levels

4. **Optimization Strategy**
   - Focus on one component at a time
   - Track changes systematically
   - Validate improvements

## MCP Tool Calling Support

The MetaPrompt Optimizer is the only optimizer that currently supports **MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool calling optimization**. This means you can optimize prompts that include MCP tools and function calls.

<Note>
  MCP tool calling optimization is a specialized feature that allows the optimizer to understand and optimize prompts
  that use external tools and functions through the Model Context Protocol. This is particularly useful for complex
  agent workflows that require tool usage.
