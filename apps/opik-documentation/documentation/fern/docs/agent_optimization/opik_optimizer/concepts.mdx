# Core Concepts

## Overview

Understanding the core concepts of the Opik Optimizer is essential for unlocking
its full potential in LLM evaluation and optimization. This section explains the
foundational terms, processes, and strategies that underpin effective agent and
prompt optimization within Opik.

## What is Agent Optimization?

Agent Optimization in Opik refers to the systematic process of refining prompts
and evaluating their effectiveness to maximize AI model performance. This
iterative approach leverages continuous testing, data-driven refinement, and
advanced evaluation techniques to deliver robust, reproducible results.

## Key Terms

### Runs and Trials

- **Run:** A single execution of a prompt optimization process using a specific
  configuration.
- **Trial:** A complete cycle of optimization, including multiple runs and
  iterative refinements to ensure statistical significance.

### Optimizers

- Specialized algorithms designed to enhance prompt effectiveness. Each
  optimizer employs unique strategies and configurable parameters to address
  specific optimization goals.

### Multi-Agent Optimization

- Involves multiple AI agents, each potentially serving different roles
  (evaluator, refiner, critic), working collaboratively to evaluate and improve
  prompts from diverse perspectives.

### Datasets and Evaluation

- **Training Dataset:** Used for prompt optimization and model improvement.
- **Validation Dataset:** Used to assess the effectiveness of the optimization.
- **Ground Truth:** The expected output for a given input, serving as a
  benchmark for evaluation.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Quantitative measures (e.g., accuracy, efficiency,
  hallucination rate) used to assess optimization success.

## Optimization Workflow

1. **Initialization**
   - Select the optimizer and configure parameters.
   - Prepare and validate datasets.
2. **Trial Execution**
   - Run optimization trials and collect results.
   - Evaluate performance using defined metrics.
3. **Analysis**
   - Compare results, identify improvements, and generate actionable insights.
4. **Refinement**
   - Adjust parameters, modify prompts, and prepare for the next iteration.
5. **Validation**
   - Test on validation datasets, measure improvements, and document findings.

## Optimization Strategies

### Few-shot Learning

- Uses curated examples to guide prompt optimization, enabling adaptation to
  specific use cases.

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

- Leverages the strengths of multiple agents to provide comprehensive evaluation
  and diverse feedback.

### Iterative Refinement

- Employs a continuous improvement cycle, making data-driven adjustments for
  progressive optimization.

## Best Practices

1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Ensure datasets contain sufficient and diverse examples.
   - Maintain high-quality ground truth and consistent formatting.
2. **Parameter Selection**
   - Start with recommended defaults, then iteratively adjust based on results.
   - Document all changes for reproducibility.
3. **Evaluation**
   - Use appropriate, task-relevant metrics and consider multiple perspectives.
   - Validate improvements and thoroughly document findings.
