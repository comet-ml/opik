# Core Concepts

## Overview

Understanding the core concepts of the Opik Optimizer is crucial for leveraging
its full potential. This section provides a detailed explanation of the key
terms and processes involved in optimizing AI models.

## Agent Optimization Overview

Agent Optimization in Opik involves systematically refining prompts and
evaluating their effectiveness to enhance AI model performance. This iterative
process ensures optimal results through continuous testing and refinement.

## Key Terms

### Trials/Iterations

- **Trial**: A single attempt to optimize a prompt using a specific
  configuration.
- **Iteration**: A complete cycle of optimization, including testing and
  refinement. Multiple trials are typically run in each iteration to ensure
  statistical significance.

### Optimizers

- Specialized algorithms designed to improve prompt effectiveness. Each
  optimizer employs different strategies and techniques, configurable with various
  parameters to suit specific needs.

### Multi-agent Optimization

- Utilizes multiple AI agents to evaluate and refine prompts. Agents can have
  different roles (e.g., evaluator, refiner, critic), enabling comprehensive
  optimization through diverse perspectives.

### Datasets and Evaluation

- **Training Dataset**: Used to optimize prompts.
- **Validation Dataset**: Used to evaluate optimization effectiveness.
- **Ground Truth**: Expected outputs for given inputs.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures of optimization success.

## Optimization Process Flow

1. **Initialization**

   - Select optimizer type and configure parameters.
   - Prepare dataset for optimization.

2. **Trial Execution**

   - Run optimization trials and collect results.
   - Evaluate performance based on metrics.

3. **Analysis**

   - Compare results and identify improvements.

4. **Refinement**

   - Adjust parameters and modify prompts.
   - Prepare for the next iteration.

5. **Validation**
   - Test on validation set and measure improvements.
   - Document results and insights.

## Optimization Strategies

### Few-shot Learning

- Leverages examples to guide prompt optimization, adapting to specific use cases.

### Multi-agent Collaboration

- Combines multiple perspectives for comprehensive evaluation and diverse feedback.

### Iterative Refinement

- Continuous improvement cycle with data-driven adjustments for progressive optimization.

## Best Practices

1. **Dataset Preparation**

   - Ensure sufficient examples and include diverse scenarios.
   - Maintain quality ground truth and consistent formatting.

2. **Parameter Selection**

   - Start with recommended defaults and adjust based on results.
   - Document changes for future reference.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Use appropriate metrics and consider multiple perspectives.
   - Validate improvements and document findings.
