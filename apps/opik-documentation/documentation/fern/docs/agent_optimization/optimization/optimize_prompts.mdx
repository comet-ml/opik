Use this playbook whenever you need to improve a prompt (single-turn or agentic) and want a repeatable process rather than manual tweaks.

## 1. Establish baselines

- Record the current prompt and score using your production metric.
- Log at least 10 representative dataset rows so the optimizer can generalize.
- Capture latency and token costs—optimizations should not regress them unexpectedly.

## 2. Choose an optimizer

| Scenario | Recommended optimizer |
| --- | --- |
| General prompt copy edits | [MetaPrompt](/agent_optimization/algorithms/metaprompt_optimizer) |
| Complex failure analysis | [HRPO](/agent_optimization/algorithms/hierarchical_adaptive_optimizer) |
| Need diverse candidates | [Evolutionary](/agent_optimization/algorithms/evolutionary_optimizer) |
| Few-shot heavy prompts | [Few-Shot Bayesian](/agent_optimization/algorithms/fewshot_bayesian_optimizer) |
| Tune sampling params | [Parameter optimizer](/agent_optimization/algorithms/parameter_optimizer) |

## 3. Configure the run

```python
from opik_optimizer import HRPO

optimizer = HRPO(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    max_parallel_batches=4,
    seed=42,
)
result = optimizer.optimize_prompt(
    prompt=my_prompt,
    dataset=my_dataset,
    metric=answer_quality,
    max_trials=5,
    n_samples=50,
)
```

- Set `project_name` on the `ChatPrompt` to group runs by team or initiative.
- Start with `max_trials` = 3–5. Increase once you confirm the metric is reliable.
- Use `n_samples` to limit cost during early exploration; rerun on the full dataset before promoting a prompt.

## 4. Evaluate outcomes

- Compare `result.score` vs. `result.initial_score` to ensure material improvement.
- Review the `history` attribute for regression reasons.
- Use [Dashboard results](/agent_optimization/optimization/dashboard_results) to visualize per-trial performance.

## 5. Ship safely

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export the prompt">
    `result.prompt` returns the best-performing `ChatPrompt`. Serialize it as JSON and check it into your repo.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automate regression tests">
    Wire the optimizer run into CI with a smaller dataset so future prompt edits have guardrails.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor in production">
    Trace the new prompt with Opik tracing to confirm real-world performance matches experiment results.
  </Step>
</Steps>
