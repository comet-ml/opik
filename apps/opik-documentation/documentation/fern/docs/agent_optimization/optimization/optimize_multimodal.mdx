Multimodal agents often juggle text instructions, images, audio, video, and structured outputs. Opik’s optimizers can work with any model that LiteLLM supports for non-text modalities (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet vision, etc.). Make sure that both the optimizer’s `model` and your `ChatPrompt.model` accept the modality you plan to optimize. Otherwise, the run will fail or silently ignore the media.

### Optimizer multimodal support

Use optimizers that can forward OpenAI-style content parts (string or an array of structured parts like `{ type: "text" | "image_url" }`) to a multimodal LLM. Current support:

| Optimizer | Multimodal (text+image) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HRPO (Hierarchical Reflective Prompt Optimizer) | ✓ | Ensure both optimizer `model` and `ChatPrompt.model` are multimodal-capable. |
| MetaPrompt Optimizer | ✓ | Uses content parts; requires a multimodal-capable model for evaluation. |
| Evolutionary Optimizer | ✓ | Uses content parts; requires a multimodal-capable model for evaluation. |
| Few-shot Bayesian Optimizer | ✓ | Uses content parts; requires a multimodal-capable model for evaluation. |
| Parameter Optimizer | ✓ | Tunes parameters only, but supports multimodal prompts for evaluation. |
| GEPA Optimizer | ✓ | Uses content parts; requires a multimodal-capable model for evaluation. |

## Dataset design

- Store image, audio, or video references as signed URLs in your dataset items (for example `metadata["image_url"]`, `metadata["audio_url"]`, or `metadata["video_url"]`).
- Include textual descriptions alongside assets so metrics can run without downloading large files when possible.
- Tag rows with modality info (`metadata["modality"] = "image+text"`) to filter during analysis.

## Prompt structure

```python
from opik_optimizer import ChatPrompt

prompt = ChatPrompt(
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Analyze the provided image and answer the question."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Question: {question}"},
                {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "{image_url}"}},
            ],
        },
    ],
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini"
)
```

- Describe the expected output schema (JSON, markdown table, etc.) to reduce ambiguity.

## Metrics

- Reuse existing text metrics when possible by comparing textual descriptions.
- For vision-specific scoring, call external models from your metric function, but cache results to control cost.
- Record reasons that mention the modality: “Image not described” or “Chart incorrectly transcribed”.
- When possible, augment automated metrics with lightweight human review or deterministic checks—LLM-as-a-judge signals can be noisy for multimodal tasks.

## Running optimizations

- Start with MetaPrompt for wording improvements. For cold-start exploration, pair Evolutionary → Few-Shot Bayesian to uncover new structures and example choices.
- Use HRPO to catch recurring multimodal failures (e.g., missing chart descriptions) and highlight which dataset rows are problematic.
- Monitor token usage because multimodal prompts send larger payloads; pick models like `gpt-4o-mini` when budgets are tight.
- All prompt optimizers can forward multimodal content parts, but evaluation will fail if the chosen models do not support the modality. Use multimodal-capable models for both optimizer generation and prompt evaluation.

## Validation

- Spot-check generated outputs with the associated media in the dashboard.
- Confirm that dataset asset URLs remain valid for the duration of the optimization.
- When sharing results, include thumbnails or sample outputs so reviewers understand the changes.
