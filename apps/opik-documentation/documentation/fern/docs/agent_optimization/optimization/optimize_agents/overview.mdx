Agent frameworks orchestrate complex chains of prompts and tools. This section explains how to pair those frameworks with Opik datasets, metrics, and optimizers.

## How agent optimization works

1. **Log traces** from your agent (LangGraph, Google ADK, etc.) into Opik so you can collect datasets and failure examples.
2. **Snapshot the agent prompt or plan** as a `ChatPrompt` or optimizer-ready artifact.
3. **Run optimizers** (MetaPrompt, Hierarchical Reflective, etc.) using your agent’s datasets.
4. **Deploy the improved instructions** back into the agent runtime.

Use the sub-guides for framework-specific wiring:

- [LangGraph](/agent_optimization/optimization/optimize_agents/langgraph)
- [Google ADK](/agent_optimization/optimization/optimize_agents/google_adk)
- [OpenAI Agents (coming soon)](/agent_optimization/optimization/optimize_agents/openai_agents)
