We are actively validating the Agent Optimizer with OpenAI’s Agents API. The workflow will mirror LangGraph/ADK guides:

1. **Trace** agent runs through the OpenAI logging hooks or by proxying API calls via Opik’s tracing client.
2. **Export** representative datasets (inputs, expected outputs, tool payloads) into Opik datasets.
3. **Optimize** the agent’s system prompt, instructions, or tool policies using MetaPrompt or Hierarchical Reflective.
4. **Deploy** the updated prompt back to OpenAI Agents and monitor the impact in Opik.
