After each optimization run, visit the Opik dashboard to understand what changed and decide whether to ship the new prompt.

## Navigate to your run

1. Open [https://www.comet.com/opik](https://www.comet.com/opik).
2. Select the **Agent Optimization** workspace or the project you set on your `ChatPrompt`.
3. Click the latest optimization run to open the detail view.

## Key panels

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trial table">
    Shows each candidate prompt, its score, metric breakdowns, and token usage. Sort by improvement to spot the best candidate quickly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Failure modes">
    Hierarchical Reflective runs group similar failures. Expand a failure mode to read metric reasons and representative traces.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dataset coverage">
    Confirms how many dataset rows were sampled per trial so you can judge statistical significance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Trace explorer">
    Dive into individual runs, inspect tool calls, and compare outputs side-by-side.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Export results

Use the **Download** button in the run header to export:
- Optimized prompt JSON
- Trial history CSV
- Metric breakdowns (per sample)

You can also programmatically access the results:

```python
from opik_optimizer import optimization_result

optimized_prompt = result.prompt
history = result.history
```

## Next steps

- Feed the exported prompt back into your application.
- Attach dashboards or screenshots to your PR so reviewers understand the improvement.
- Archive notable runs using Opik’s pin feature for future reference.
