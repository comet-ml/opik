After each optimization run, visit the Opik dashboard to understand what changed and decide whether to ship the new prompt.

## Navigate to your run

1. Open [https://www.comet.com/opik](https://www.comet.com/opik).
2. In the left nav, click **Optimization runs** under **Evaluation**.
3. Select the run you care about (grouped by dataset + optimizer). The detail view shows charts, trials, prompts, and per-sample traces.

## Key panels

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optimization progress chart">
    Plots every trial score in chronological order and highlights the current best prompt. Hover to read exact values and see percentage improvements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Trial table">
    Lists each trial, the optimizer used, the prompt JSON, and per-trial scores. Click a trial row to expand dataset items and attached traces.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Examples & traces">
    When you expand a trial, you can inspect every dataset item that ran during that trial plus the corresponding trace tree (tool calls, attachments, etc.).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Failure modes (reflective runs only)">
    HRPO runs add a panel that clusters similar failures. Expand a cluster to read metric reasons and sample traces.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dataset coverage">
    Confirms how many dataset rows were sampled per trial so you can judge statistical significance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reuse results

While the UI currently focuses on analysis, you can always pull prompts and history directly from the SDK after the run finishes:

```python
# result is the OptimizationResult returned by your optimizer call
optimized_prompt = result.prompt
history = result.history
```

Use `optimized_prompt` to update your application and `history` to build custom reports or attach evidence to pull requests.

## Next steps

- Feed the exported prompt back into your application.
- Attach dashboards or screenshots to your PR so reviewers understand the improvement.
