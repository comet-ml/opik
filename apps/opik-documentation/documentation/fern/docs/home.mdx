Opik is an [open-source](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik) logging, debugging, and optimization
platform for AI agents and LLM applications. If you're building AI features, you know it's easy to
spin up a working prototype but harder to log, test, iterate, and monitor to meet production
requirements.

Opik gives you all the tools you need to go from LLM observability to action across your AI
application footprint and dev cycle. Ship measurable improvements with gorgeous logs, annotation and
scoring functions, pre-configured LLM-as-a-judge [eval metrics](/evaluation/metrics/overview), and
even [automated agent optimization algorithms](/agent_optimization/overview) to maximize performance.

## Open-Source access meets enterprise performance

All Opik versions ([cloud](https://www.comet.com/signup?from=llm),
[open source](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik), and
[enterprise](https://www.comet.com/site/pricing/)) include the full AI engineering featureset
and run on the Comet platform, with proven performance at scale supporting many of the world's
largest organizations. 

Compare Opik to other LLM observability tools and you'll find that traces populate faster,
evaluations run smoother, and reliability comes standard â€” even for complex agentic systems serving
millions of users in production.
