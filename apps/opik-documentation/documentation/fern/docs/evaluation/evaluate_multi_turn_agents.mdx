When working on chatbots or multi-turn agents, it can become a challenge to evaluate the agent's
behavior over multiple turns as you don't know what the user would have asked as a follow-up
question based on the previous turns.

To achieve multi-turn evaluation, we can turn to simulation techniques to simulate the user's
response based on the previous turns. The core idea is that we can use an LLM to simulate what the
user would have responded based on the previous turns and run this for a number of turns.

Once we have this conversation, we can use Opik evaluation features to score the agent's behavior.

## Creating the user simulator

In order to perform multi-turn evaluation, we need to create a user simulator that will generate
the user's response based on previous turns

```python title="User simulator" maxLines=1000
from opik.simulation import SimulatedUser

user_simulator = SimulatedUser(
    persona="You are a frustrated user who wants a refund",
    model="openai/gpt-4.1",
)

# Generate a user message that will start the conversation
print(user_simulator.generate_response([
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, how can I help you today?"}
]))

# Generate a user message based on a couple of back and forth turns
print(user_simulator.generate_response([
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, how can I help you today?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "My product just broke 2 days after I bought it, I want a refund."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"}
]))
```

Now that we have a way to simulate the user, we can create multiple simulations that we will in
turn evaluate.

## Running simulations

Now that we have a way to simulate the user, we can create multiple simulations:

<Steps>
    <Step title="1. Create a list of scenarios">
        In order to more easily keep track of the scenarios we will be running, let's create a
        dataset with the user personas we will be using:

        ```python title="Running simulations" maxLines=1000
        import opik

        opik_client = opik.Opik()
        dataset = opik_client.get_or_create_dataset(name="Multi-turn evaluation")
        dataset.insert([
            {"user_persona": "You are a frustrated user who wants a refund"},
            {"user_persona": "You are a user who is happy with your product and wants to buy more"},
            {"user_persona": "You are a user who is having trouble with your product and wants to get help"}
        ])
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="2. Create our agent app">
        In order to run the simulations, we need to create our agent app based on our existing
        agent. The `run_agent` function we will be creating will have the following signature:

        ```python title="Run agent function signature" maxLines=1000
        from langchain.agents import create_agent
        from opik.integrations.langchain import OpikTracer

        opik_tracer = OpikTracer()

        agent = create_agent(
            model="openai:gpt-4.1",
            tools=[],
            system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
        )

        agent_history = {}

        def run_agent(user_message: str, *, thread_id: str, **kwargs) -> dict[str, str]:
            if thread_id not in agent_history:
                agent_history[thread_id] = []
            
            agent_history[thread_id].append({"role": "user", "content": user_message})
            messages = agent_history[thread_id]

            response = agent.invoke({"messages": messages}, config={"callbacks": [opik_tracer]})
            agent_history[thread_id] = response["messages"]

            return response["messages"][-1].content
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="3. Run the simulations">
        Now that we have a dataset with the user personas, we can run the simulations:

        ```python title="Running simulations" maxLines=1000
        import opik
        from opik.simulation import run_simulation

        # Fetch the user personas
        opik_client = opik.Opik()
        dataset = opik_client.get_or_create_dataset(name="Multi-turn evaluation")

        # Run the simulations
        all_simulations = []
        for item in dataset.get_items():
            user_persona = item["user_persona"]
            user_simulator = SimulatedUser(
                persona=user_persona,
                model="openai/gpt-4.1",
            )
            simulation = run_simulation(
                app=run_agent,
                user_simulator=user_simulator,
                max_turns=5,
            )

            all_simulations.append(simulation)
        ```

        <Tip>
        The `run_simulation` function keeps track of the internal conversation state by constructing
        a list of messages with the result of the `run_agent` function as an assistant message and
        the `UserSimulator`'s response as a user message.

        If you need more complex conversation state, you can create threads using the `UserSimulator`'s
        `generate_response` method directly.
        </Tip>

        The simulated threads will be available in the Opik thread UI:

        <Frame>
            <img src="/img/evaluation/multi_turn_evaluation_threads.png" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Scoring threads

When working on evaluating multi-turn conversations, you can use one of Opik's built-in conversation
metrics or [create your own](/evaluation/metrics/custom_conversation_metric).

If you've used the `run_simulation` function, you will already have a list of conversation messages
that you can pass directly to the metrics, otherwise you can use the `evaluate_threads` function:
<CodeBlock>
    ```python title="Scoring simulations" maxLines=1000
    import opik
    from opik.evaluation.metrics import ConversationalCoherenceMetric, UserFrustrationMetric

    opik_client = opik.Opik()

    # Define the metrics you want to use
    conversation_coherence_metric = ConversationalCoherenceMetric()
    user_frustration_metric = UserFrustrationMetric()

    for simulation in all_simulations:
        conversation = simulation["conversation_history"]

        coherence_score = conversation_coherence_metric.score(conversation)
        frustration_score = user_frustration_metric.score(conversation)

        opik_client.log_threads_feedback_scores(
            scores=[
                {
                    "id": simulation["thread_id"],
                    "name": "conversation_coherence",
                    "value": coherence_score.value,
                    "reason": coherence_score.reason
                },
                {
                    "id": simulation["thread_id"],
                    "name": "user_frustration",
                    "value": frustration_score.value,
                    "reason": frustration_score.reason
                }
            ]
        )
    ```

    ```python title="Using evaluate_threads"
    from opik.evaluation import evaluate_threads
    from opik.evaluation.metrics import ConversationalCoherenceMetric, UserFrustrationMetric

    opik_client = opik.Opik()

    conversation_coherence_metric = ConversationalCoherenceMetric()
    user_frustration_metric = UserFrustrationMetric()

    results = evaluate_threads(
        project_name="multi_turn_evaluation",
        filter_string=f'thread_id = "<THREAD_ID>"',
        metrics=[conversation_coherence_metric, user_frustration_metric],
        trace_input_transform=lambda x: x["input"],
        trace_output_transform=lambda x: x["output"],
    )
    ```
</CodeBlock>

<Tip>
You can learn more about the `evaluate_threads` function in the [evaluate_threads guide](/evaluation/evaluate_threads).

Once the threads have been scored, you can view the results in the Opik thread UI:
