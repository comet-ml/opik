subtitle: Step by step guide on how to evaluate your LLM application
---

Evaluating your LLM application allows you to have confidence in the performance of your LLM application. In this guide, we will walk through the process of evaluating complex applications like LLM chains or agents.

<Tip>
  In this guide, we will focus on evaluating complex LLM applications. If you are looking at evaluating single prompts
  you can refer to the [Evaluate A Prompt](/evaluation/evaluate_prompt) guide.
</Tip>

The evaluation is done in five steps:

1. Add tracing to your LLM application
2. Define the evaluation task
3. Choose the `Dataset` that you would like to evaluate your application on
4. Choose the metrics that you would like to evaluate your application with
5. Create and run the evaluation experiment

## Running an offline evaluation

### 1. (Optional) Add tracking to your LLM application

While not required, we recommend adding tracking to your LLM application. This allows you to have
full visibility into each evaluation run. In the example below we will use a combination of the
`track` decorator and the `track_openai` function to trace the LLM application.

<CodeBlocks>
    ```python title="Python" language="python"
    from opik import track
    from opik.integrations.openai import track_openai
    import openai

    openai_client = track_openai(openai.OpenAI())

    # This method is the LLM application that you want to evaluate
    # Typically this is not updated when creating evaluations
    @track
    def your_llm_application(input: str) -> str:
        response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": input}],
        )

        return response.choices[0].message.content
    ```

</CodeBlocks>

<Tip>
  Here we have added the `track` decorator so that this trace and all its nested steps are logged to the platform for
  further analysis.
</Tip>

### 2. Define the evaluation task

Once you have added instrumentation to your LLM application, we can define the evaluation
task. The evaluation task takes in as an input a dataset item and needs to return a
dictionary with keys that match the parameters expected by the metrics you are using. In
this example we can define the evaluation task as follows:

<CodeBlocks>
```typescript title="TypeScript" language="typescript"
import { EvaluationTask } from "opik";
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

// Define dataset item type
type DatasetItem = {
    input: string;
    expected: string;
};

const llmTask: EvaluationTask<DatasetItem> = async (datasetItem) => {
    const { input } = datasetItem;

    const openai = new OpenAI();
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4o",
        messages: [
            { role: "system", content: "You are a coding assistant" },
            { role: "user", content: input }
        ],
    });

    return { output: response.choices[0].message.content };

};
```

```python title="Python" language="python"
def evaluation_task(x):
    return {
        "output": your_llm_application(x['user_question'])
    }
```

</CodeBlocks>

<Warning>
  If the dictionary returned does not match with the parameters expected by the metrics, you will get inconsistent
  evaluation results.
</Warning>

### 3. Choose the evaluation Dataset

In order to create an evaluation experiment, you will need to have a Dataset that includes
all your test cases.

If you have already created a Dataset, you can use the get or create dataset methods to
fetch it.

<CodeBlocks>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript" language="typescript"
    import { Opik } from "opik";

    const client = new Opik();
    const dataset = await client.getOrCreateDataset<DatasetItem>("Example dataset");

    // Opik deduplicates items that are inserted into a dataset so we can insert them
    // for multiple times
    await dataset.insert([
        {
            input: "Hello, world!",
            expected: "Hello, world!"
        },
        {
            input: "What is the capital of France?",
            expected: "Paris"
        },
    ]);
    ```

    ```python title="Python" language="python"
    from opik import Opik

    client = Opik()
    dataset = client.get_or_create_dataset(name="Example dataset")

    # Opik deduplicates items that are inserted into a dataset so we can insert them
    # for multiple times
    dataset.insert([
        {
            "input": "Hello, world!",
            "expected_output": "Hello, world!"
        },
        {
            "input": "What is the capital of France?",
            "expected_output": "Paris"
        },
    ])
    ```
    </CodeBlocks>

### 4. Choose evaluation metrics

Opik provides a set of built-in evaluation metrics that you can choose from. These are broken down into two main categories:

1. Heuristic metrics: These metrics that are deterministic in nature, for example `equals` or `contains`
2. LLM-as-a-judge: These metrics use an LLM to judge the quality of the output; typically these are used for detecting `hallucinations` or `context relevance`

In the same evaluation experiment, you can use multiple metrics to evaluate your application:

<CodeBlocks>
```typescript title="TypeScript" language="typescript"
import { ExactMatch } from "opik";

const exact_match_metric = new ExactMatch();
```

```python title="Python" language="python"
from opik.evaluation.metrics import Hallucination

hallucination_metric = Hallucination()
```

</CodeBlocks>

<Tip>
  Each metric expects the data in a certain format. You will need to ensure that the task you have defined in step 2
  returns the data in the correct format.
</Tip>

### 5. Run the evaluation

Now that we have the task we want to evaluate, the dataset to evaluate on, and the metrics
we want to evaluate with, we can run the evaluation:

<CodeBlocks>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript" language="typescript" maxLines=1000
    import { EvaluationTask, Opik, ExactMatch, evaluate } from "opik";
    import { OpenAI } from "openai";

    // Define dataset item type
    type DatasetItem = {
        input: string;
        expected: string;
    };

    // Define the evaluation task
    const llmTask: EvaluationTask<DatasetItem> = async (datasetItem) => {
        const { input } = datasetItem;

        const openai = new OpenAI();
        const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
            model: "gpt-4o",
            messages: [
                { role: "system", content: "You are a coding assistant" },
                { role: "user", content: input }
            ],
        });

        return { output: response.choices[0].message.content };
    };

    // Get or create the dataset - items are automatically deduplicated
    const client = new Opik();
    const dataset = await client.getOrCreateDataset<DatasetItem>("Example dataset");
    await dataset.insert([
        {
            input: "Hello, world!",
            expected: "Hello, world!"
        },
        {
            input: "What is the capital of France?",
            expected: "Paris"
        },
    ]);

    // Define the metric
    const exact_match_metric = new ExactMatch();

    // Run the evaluation
    const result = await evaluate({
        dataset,
        task: llmTask,
        scoringMetrics: [exact_match_metric],
        experimentName: "Example Evaluation",
    });
    console.log(`Experiment ID: ${result.experimentId}`);
    console.log(`Experiment Name: ${result.experimentName}`);
    console.log(`Total test cases: ${result.testResults.length}`);
    ```

    ```python title="Python" language="python" maxLines=1000
    from opik import Opik, track
    from opik.evaluation import evaluate
    from opik.evaluation.metrics import Equals, Hallucination
    from opik.integrations.openai import track_openai
    import openai

    # Define the task to evaluate
    openai_client = track_openai(openai.OpenAI())

    MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

    @track
    def your_llm_application(input: str) -> str:
        response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            model=MODEL,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": input}],
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content

    # Define the evaluation task
    def evaluation_task(x):
        return {
            "output": your_llm_application(x['input'])
        }

    # Create a simple dataset
    client = Opik()
    dataset = client.get_or_create_dataset(name="Example dataset")
    dataset.insert([
        {"input": "What is the capital of France?"},
        {"input": "What is the capital of Germany?"},
    ])

    # Define the metrics
    hallucination_metric = Hallucination()

    evaluation = evaluate(
        dataset=dataset,
        task=evaluation_task,
        scoring_metrics=[hallucination_metric],
        experiment_config={
            "model": MODEL
        }
    )
    ```

</CodeBlocks>

<Tip>
  You can use the `experiment_config` parameter to store information about your evaluation task. Typically we see teams
  store information about the prompt template, the model used and model parameters used to evaluate the application.
</Tip>

### 6. Analyze the evaluation results

Once the evaluation is complete, you will get a link to the Opik UI where you can analyze the
evaluation results. In addition to being able to deep dive into each test case, you will also
be able to compare multiple experiments side by side.

## Advanced usage

### Missing arguments for scoring methods

When you face the `opik.exceptions.ScoreMethodMissingArguments` exception, it means that the dataset
item and task output dictionaries do not contain all the arguments expected by the scoring method.
The way the evaluate function works is by merging the dataset item and task output dictionaries and
then passing the result to the scoring method. For example, if the dataset item contains the keys
`user_question` and `context` while the evaluation task returns a dictionary with the key `output`,
the scoring method will be called as `scoring_method.score(user_question='...', context= '...', output= '...')`.
This can be an issue if the scoring method expects a different set of arguments.

You can solve this by either updating the dataset item or evaluation task to return the missing
arguments or by using the `scoring_key_mapping` parameter of the `evaluate` function. In the example
above, if the scoring method expects `input` as an argument, you can map the `user_question` key to
the `input` key as follows:

<CodeBlocks>
```typescript title="TypeScript" language="typescript"
evaluation = evaluate({
    dataset,
    task: evaluation_task,
    scoringMetrics: [hallucination_metric],
    scoringKeyMapping: {"input": "user_question"},
})
```

```python title="Python" language="python"
evaluation = evaluate(
    dataset=dataset,
    task=evaluation_task,
    scoring_metrics=[hallucination_metric],
    scoring_key_mapping={"input": "user_question"},
)
```

</CodeBlocks>

### Linking prompts to experiments

The [Opik prompt library](/prompt_engineering/prompt_management) can be used to version your prompt templates.

When creating an Experiment, you can link the Experiment to a specific prompt version:

<CodeBlocks>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript" language="typescript"
    // Coming soon
    ```

    ```python title="Python" language="python"
    import opik

    # Create a prompt
    prompt = opik.Prompt(
        name="My prompt",
        prompt="..."
    )

    # Run the evaluation
    evaluation = evaluate(
        dataset=dataset,
        task=evaluation_task,
        scoring_metrics=[hallucination_metric],
        prompts=[prompt],
    )
    ```

</CodeBlocks>

The experiment will now be linked to the prompt allowing you to view all experiments that use a specific prompt:

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/evaluation/linked_prompt.png" />
</Frame>

### Logging traces to a specific project

You can use the `project_name` parameter of the `evaluate` function to log evaluation traces to a specific project:

<CodeBlocks>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript" language="typescript"
    const evaluation = await evaluate({
        dataset,
        task: evaluation_task,
        scoringMetrics: [hallucination_metric],
        projectName: "hallucination-detection",
    })
    ```

    ```python title="Python" language="python"
    evaluation = evaluate(
        dataset=dataset,
        task=evaluation_task,
        scoring_metrics=[hallucination_metric],
        project_name="hallucination-detection",
    )
    ```

</CodeBlocks>

### Evaluating a subset of the dataset

You can use the `nb_samples` parameter to specify the number of samples to use for the evaluation. This is useful if you only want to evaluate a subset of the dataset.

<CodeBlocks>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript" language="typescript"
    const evaluation = await evaluate({
        dataset,
        task: evaluation_task,
        scoringMetrics: [hallucination_metric],
        nbSamples: 10,
    })
    ```

    ```python title="Python" language="python"
    evaluation = evaluate(
        experiment_name="My experiment",
        dataset=dataset,
        task=evaluation_task,
        scoring_metrics=[hallucination_metric],
        nb_samples=10,
    )
    ```

</CodeBlocks>

### Sampling the dataset for evaluation

You can use the `dataset_sampler` parameter to specify the instance of dataset sampler to use for sampling the dataset.
This is useful if you want to sample the dataset differently than the default sampling strategy (accept all items).

For example, you can use the `RandomDatasetSampler` to sample the dataset randomly:

<CodeBlocks>
    ```python title="Python" language="python"
    from opik.evaluation import samplers

    evaluation = evaluate(
        experiment_name="My experiment",
        dataset=dataset,
        task=evaluation_task,
        scoring_metrics=[hallucination_metric],
        dataset_sampler=samplers.RandomDatasetSampler(max_samples=10),
    )
    ```

</CodeBlocks>

In the example above, the evaluation will sample 10 random items from the dataset.

Also, you can implement your own dataset sampler by extending the `BaseDatasetSampler` and overriding the `sample` method.

<CodeBlocks>
    ```python title="Python" language="python"
    import re
    from typing import List

    from opik.api_objects.dataset import dataset_item
    from opik.evaluation import samplers

    class MyDatasetSampler(samplers.BaseDatasetSampler):

        def __init__(self, filter_string: str, field_name: str) -> None:
            self.filter_regex = re.compile(filter_string)
            self.field_name = field_name

        def sample(self, dataset: List[dataset_item.DatasetItem]) -> List[dataset_item.DatasetItem]:
            # Sample items from the dataset that match the filter string in the 'field_name' field
            return [item for item in filter(lambda x: self.filter_regex.search(x[self.field_name]), dataset)]

    # Example usage
    evaluation = evaluate(
        experiment_name="My experiment",
        dataset=dataset,
        task=evaluation_task,
        scoring_metrics=[hallucination_metric],
        dataset_sampler=MyDatasetSampler(filter_string="\\.*SUCCESS\\.*", field_name="output"),
    )

    ```

</CodeBlocks>

Implementing your own dataset sampler is useful if you want to implement a custom sampling strategy. For instance,
you can implement a dataset sampler that samples the dataset using some filtering criteria as in the example above.

### Analyzing the evaluation results

The `evaluate` function returns an `EvaluationResult` object that contains the evaluation results.
You can create aggregated statistics for each metric by calling its `aggregate_evaluation_scores` method:

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python" language="python"
    evaluation = evaluate(
        experiment_name="My experiment",
        dataset=dataset,
        task=evaluation_task,
        scoring_metrics=[hallucination_metric],
    )

    # Retrieve and print the aggregated scores statistics (mean, min, max, std) per metric
    scores = evaluation.aggregate_evaluation_scores()
    for metric_name, statistics in scores.aggregated_scores.items():
        print(f"{metric_name}: {statistics}")

    ```

</CodeBlocks>

Aggregated statistics can help analyze evaluation results and are useful for comparing the
performance of different models or different versions of the same model, for example.

### Python SDK

#### Using async evaluation tasks

The `evaluate` function does not support `async` evaluation tasks, if you pass
an async task you will get an error similar to:

```python wordWrap
Input should be a valid dictionary [type=dict_type, input_value='<coroutine object kyc_qu...ng_task at 0x3336d0a40>', input_type=str]
```

As it might not always be possible to convert all your LLM logic to not rely on async logic,
we recommend using `asyncio.run` within the evaluation task:

```python
import asyncio

async def your_llm_application(input: str) -> str:
    return "Hello, World"

def evaluation_task(x):
    # your_llm_application here is an async function
    result = asyncio.run(your_llm_application(x['input']))
    return {
        "output": result
    }
```

This should solve the issue and allow you to run the evaluation.

<Tip>
If you are running in a Jupyter notebook, you will need to add the following line to the top of your notebook:

```python
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()
```

otherwise you might get the error `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`

</Tip>

<Warning>
  The `evaluate` function uses multi-threading under the hood to speed up the evaluation run. Using both
  `asyncio` and multi-threading can lead to unexpected behavior and hard to debug errors.

If you run into any issues, you can disable the multi-threading in the SDK by setting `task_threads` to 1:

```python
evaluation = evaluate(
    dataset=dataset,
    task=evaluation_task,
    scoring_metrics=[hallucination_metric],
    task_threads=1
)
```

</Warning>

#### Disabling threading

In order to evaluate datasets more efficiently, Opik uses multiple background threads to evaluate the dataset. If this is causing issues, you can disable these by setting `task_threads` and `scoring_threads` to `1` which will lead Opik to run all calculations in the main thread.

#### Passing additional arguments to `evaluation_task`

Sometimes your evaluation task needs extra context besides the dataset item (commonly referred to as `x`). For example, you may want to pass a model name, a system prompt, or a pre-initialized client.
Since `evaluate` calls the task as `task(x)` for each dataset item, the recommended pattern is to create a wrapper (or use `functools.partial`) that closes over any additional arguments.

Using a wrapper function:

```python
# Extra dependencies you want to provide to the task
MODEL = "gpt-4o"
IMAGE_TYPE = "thumbnail"

def evaluation_task(x, model, image_type, client, prompt):
    full_response = client.get_answer(
        x["question"],
        x["image_paths"][image_type],
        prompt.format(),
        model=model,
    )
    response = full_response["response"]
    return {
        "response": response,
        "bbox": full_response.get("bounding_boxes"),
        "image_url": full_response.get("image_url"),
    }

def make_task(model, image_type, client, prompt):
    # Return a unary function that evaluate() can call as task(x)
    def _task(x):
        return evaluation_task(x, model, image_type, client, prompt)
    return _task

task = make_task(MODEL, IMAGE_TYPE, bot, system_prompt)

evaluation = evaluate(
    dataset=dataset,
    task=task,  # evaluate will call task(x) for each item
    scoring_metrics=[levenshteinratio_metric],
    scoring_key_mapping={
        "input": "question",
        "output": "response",
        "reference": "expected_answer",
    },
)
```

### Using task span evaluation metrics

Opik supports advanced evaluation metrics that can analyze the detailed execution information of your LLM tasks. These metrics receive a `task_span` parameter containing structured data about the task execution, including input, output, metadata, and nested operations.

Task span metrics are particularly useful for evaluating:
- The internal structure and behavior of your LLM applications
- Performance characteristics like execution patterns
- Quality of intermediate steps in complex workflows
- Cost and usage optimization opportunities
- Agent trajectory

#### Creating task span metrics

To create a task span evaluation metric, define a metric class that accepts a `task_span` parameter in its `score` method. The `task_span` parameter is a [`SpanModel`](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/python-sdk-reference/message_processing_emulation/SpanModel.html) object that contains detailed information about the task execution:

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python" language="python"
from typing import Any, Optional
from opik.evaluation.metrics import BaseMetric, score_result
from opik.message_processing.emulation.models import SpanModel

class ExecutionTimeMetric(BaseMetric):
    def score(self, task_span: SpanModel, **ignored_kwargs: Any) -> score_result.ScoreResult:
        # Calculate execution duration
        if task_span.start_time and task_span.end_time:
            duration = (task_span.end_time - task_span.start_time).total_seconds()

            # Score based on execution speed
            if duration < 1.0:
                score = 1.0
                reason = f"Fast execution: {duration:.2f}s"
            elif duration < 5.0:
                score = 0.8
                reason = f"Acceptable execution time: {duration:.2f}s"
            else:
                score = 0.5
                reason = f"Slow execution: {duration:.2f}s"
        else:
            score = 0.0
            reason = "Cannot determine execution time"

        return score_result.ScoreResult(
            value=score,
            name=self.name,
            reason=reason
        )
```
</CodeBlocks>

#### Using task span metrics in evaluation

Task span metrics work alongside regular evaluation metrics and are automatically detected by the evaluation engine:

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python" language="python"
from opik import evaluate
from opik.evaluation.metrics import Equals

# Create both regular and task span metrics
equals_metric = Equals()
timing_metric = ExecutionTimeMetric()

# Run evaluation with mixed metric types
evaluation = evaluate(
    dataset=dataset,
    task=evaluation_task,
    scoring_metrics=[
        equals_metric,        # Regular metric
        timing_metric,        # Task span metric
    ],
    experiment_name="Comprehensive Evaluation"
)
```
</CodeBlocks>

<Tip>
When you use task span metrics, Opik automatically enables span collection and analysis. You don't need to configure anything special - the system will detect metrics with `task_span` parameters and handle them appropriately.
</Tip>

#### Accessing span hierarchy

Task spans can contain nested spans representing sub-operations. You can analyze the complete execution hierarchy.

Here's an example of a tracked function that produces nested spans:

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python" language="python"
from opik import track
from opik.integrations.openai import track_openai
import openai

openai_client = track_openai(openai.OpenAI())

@track
def research_topic(topic: str) -> str:
    """Main research function that creates nested spans."""

    # This will create a nested span for gathering context
    context = gather_context(topic)

    # This will create another nested span for analysis
    analysis = analyze_information(context, topic)

    # Final span for generating summary
    summary = generate_summary(analysis, topic)

    return summary

@track
def gather_context(topic: str) -> str:
    """Gather background context - creates its own span."""
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Provide background context about: {topic}"
        }]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

@track
def analyze_information(context: str, topic: str) -> str:
    """Analyze the gathered information - creates its own span."""

</CodeBlocks>

You can then analyze this complete execution hierarchy using task span metrics:

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python" language="python"
class HierarchyAnalysisMetric(BaseMetric):
    def _analyze_hierarchy_recursively(self, span: SpanModel, hierarchy_stats: dict = None) -> dict:
        """Recursively analyze span hierarchy across the entire span tree."""

                'current_depth': 0,
                'llm_span_names': [],
                'tool_span_names': []
            }

        # Count current span
        hierarchy_stats['total_spans'] += 1
        hierarchy_stats['max_depth'] = max(hierarchy_stats['max_depth'], hierarchy_stats['current_depth'])

        # Categorize span types
        if span.type == "llm":
            hierarchy_stats['llm_spans'] += 1
            hierarchy_stats['llm_span_names'].append(span.name)
        elif span.type == "tool":
            hierarchy_stats['tool_spans'] += 1
            hierarchy_stats['tool_span_names'].append(span.name)
        else:
            hierarchy_stats['other_spans'] += 1

        # Recursively analyze nested spans with depth tracking
        for nested_span in span.spans:
            hierarchy_stats['current_depth'] += 1
            self._analyze_hierarchy_recursively(nested_span, hierarchy_stats)
            hierarchy_stats['current_depth'] -= 1

        return hierarchy_stats

    def score(self, task_span: SpanModel, **ignored_kwargs: Any) -> score_result.ScoreResult:
        # Analyze hierarchy across the entire span tree
        # Only for illustrative purposes.
        # Please adjust for your specific use case!
        hierarchy_stats = self._analyze_hierarchy_recursively(task_span)

        total_operations = hierarchy_stats['total_spans']
        llm_operations = hierarchy_stats['llm_spans']
        tool_operations = hierarchy_stats['tool_spans']
        max_depth = hierarchy_stats['max_depth']

        # Analyze the complexity and structure of the operation
        if llm_operations > 5:
            # Many LLM calls might indicate inefficient processing
            if tool_operations == 0:
                score = 0.4
                reason = f"Over-complex operation: {llm_operations} LLM calls with no tool usage (depth: {max_depth})"
            else:

            score = 0.3 if tool_operations > 0 else 0.1
            reason = f"No reasoning detected: {tool_operations} tool calls only" if tool_operations > 0 else "No LLM or tool operations detected"
        else:
            # Balanced approach with reasonable LLM usage
            balance_ratio = min(llm_operations, tool_operations) / max(llm_operations, tool_operations) if tool_operations > 0 else 0.8
            depth_bonus = 1.0 if max_depth <= 3 else max(0.8, 1.0 - (max_depth - 3) * 0.05)

            score = min(1.0, 0.7 + balance_ratio * 0.2 + depth_bonus * 0.1)

            if tool_operations > 0:
                reason = f"Well-structured operation: {llm_operations} LLM calls, {tool_operations} tool calls across {total_operations} spans (depth: {max_depth})"

```
</CodeBlocks>

For the `SpanModel`'s hierarchy given above the `HierarchyAnalysisMetric` metric's score will be:

<CodeBlocks>
```
    Score: 0.96, Reason: Reasoning-focused operation: 3 LLM calls across 7 spans (depth: 2)
```
</CodeBlocks>

#### Best practices for task span metrics

1. **Focus on execution patterns**: Use task span metrics to evaluate how your application executes, not just the final output
2. **Combine with regular metrics**: Mix task span metrics with traditional output-based metrics for comprehensive evaluation
3. **Analyze performance**: Leverage timing, cost, and usage information for optimization insights
4. **Handle missing data gracefully**: Always check for None values in optional span attributes

<Warning>
Task span metrics have access to detailed execution information including inputs, outputs, and metadata. Be mindful of sensitive data and ensure your metrics handle this information appropriately.
</Warning>

### Accessing logged experiments

You can access all the experiments logged to the platform from the SDK with the
`get experiment by name` methods:

<CodeBlocks>
    ```typescript title="TypeScript" language="typescript"
    import { Opik } from "opik";

    const client = new Opik({
        apiKey: "your-api-key",
        apiUrl: "https://www.comet.com/opik/api",
        projectName: "your-project-name",
        workspaceName: "your-workspace-name",
    });
    const experiments = await client.getExperimentsByName("My experiment");

    // Access the first experiment content
    const items = await experiments[0].getItems();
    console.log(items);
    ```

    ```python title="Python" language="python"
    import opik

    # Get the experiment
    opik_client = opik.Opik()
    experiments = opik_client.get_experiments_by_name("My experiment")

    # Access the first experiment content
    items = experiments[0].get_items()
    print(items)
    ```

</CodeBlocks>
