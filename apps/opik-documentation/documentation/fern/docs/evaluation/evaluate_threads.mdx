subtitle: Step-by-step guide on how to evaluate conversation threads
---

When you are running multi-turn conversations using frameworks that support LLM agents, the Opik integration will
automatically group related traces into conversation threads using parameters suitable for each framework.

This guide will walk you through the process of evaluating and optimizing conversation threads in Opik using
the `evaluate_threads` function in the Python SDK.

## Using the Python SDK

The Python SDK provides a simple and efficient way to evaluate and optimize conversation threads using the
`evaluate_threads` function. This function allows you to specify a filter string to select specific threads for
evaluation, a list of metrics to apply to each thread, and it returns a `ThreadsEvaluationResult` object
containing the evaluation results and feedback scores.

To run the threads evaluation, you can use the following code:

```python
from opik.evaluation import evaluate_threads
from opik.evaluation.metrics import ConversationalCoherenceMetric, UserFrustrationMetric

# Initialize the evaluation metrics
conversation_coherence_metric = ConversationalCoherenceMetric()
user_frustration_metric = UserFrustrationMetric()

# Run the threads evaluation
results = evaluate_threads(
    project_name="ai_team",
    filter_string='id = "0197ad2a"',
    eval_project_name="ai_team_evaluation",
    metrics=[
        conversation_coherence_metric,
        user_frustration_metric,
    ],
    trace_input_transform=lambda x: x["input"],
    trace_output_transform=lambda x: x["output"],
)
```

#### Using filter string

The `evaluate_threads` function takes a filter string as an argument. This string is used to select the threads that
should be evaluated. For example, if you want to evaluate only threads that have a specific ID, you can use the
following filter string:

```python
filter_string='id = "0197ad2a"'
```

You can combine multiple filter strings using the `AND` operator. For example, if you want to evaluate only threads
that have a specific ID and have a specific status, you can use the following filter string:

```python
filter_string='id = "0197ad2a" AND status = "inactive"'
```

**Supported filter fields and operators**

The `evaluate_threads` function supports the following filter fields in the `filter_string` using Opik Query Language (OQL).
All fields and operators are the same as those supported by `search_traces` and `search_spans`:

| Field                     | Type       | Operators                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `output`                  | String     | `=`, `contains`, `not_contains`                                             |

| `usage.total_tokens`      | Numeric    | `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`                                             |
| `usage.prompt_tokens`     | Numeric    | `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`                                             |
| `usage.completion_tokens` | Numeric    | `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`                                             |
| `duration`                | Numeric    | `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`                                             |
| `number_of_messages`      | Numeric    | `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`                                             |

**Rules:**

- String values must be wrapped in double quotes
- DateTime fields require ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z")
- Use dot notation for nested objects: `metadata.model`, `feedback_scores.accuracy`
- Multiple conditions can be combined with `AND` (OR is not supported)

The `feedback_scores` field is a dictionary where the keys are the metric names and the values are the metric values.
You can use it to filter threads based on their feedback scores. For example, if you want to evaluate only threads
that have a specific user frustration score, you can use the following filter string:

```python
filter_string='feedback_scores.user_frustration_score >= 0.5'
```

Where `user_frustration_score` is the name of the user frustration metric and `0.5` is the threshold value to filter by.

#### Using Opik UI to view results

Once the evaluation is complete, you can access the evaluation results in the Opik UI.

<Note>
  Important: The `status` field represents the status of the thread, inactive means that the thread has not received any new traces in the last 15 minutes (Default value but can be changed).
  Threads are automatically marked as inactive after the timeout period and you can also manually mark a thread as inactive via UI or via SDK.

  You can only evaluate/score threads that are inactive.
