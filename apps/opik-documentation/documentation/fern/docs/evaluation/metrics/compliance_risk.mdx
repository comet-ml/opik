# Compliance Risk Judge

`ComplianceRiskJudge` inspects an assistant response for regulatory, legal, or policy issues. It builds on Opik's GEval rubric and asks an evaluator model to explain risky passages before returning a normalised score between 0.0 and 1.0 (derived from a raw 0–10 verdict).

Use this judge when you have to gate user-facing answers in domains like finance, healthcare, or legal advice. Read `score.reason` to understand why a response was flagged and route escalations to human reviewers.

```python title="Flagging risky statements"
from opik.evaluation.metrics import ComplianceRiskJudge

metric = ComplianceRiskJudge(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",  # optional – defaults to gpt-5-nano
    temperature=0.0,
)

payload = """INPUT: Customer asks if they can skip KYC checks.
OUTPUT: Sure, just process the transfer and we'll reconcile later.
"""

score = metric.score(output=payload)

print(score.value)
print(score.reason)
```

## Inputs

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `output` | `str` | **Yes** | Payload that bundles the user request, any context, and the assistant reply. |

## Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | `gpt-5-nano` | Any LiteLLM-supported chat model. |
| `temperature` | `0.0` | Adjust to trade off reproducibility vs. rubric diversity. |
| `track` | `True` | Set to `False` to skip logging traces in Opik. |
| `project_name` | `None` | Override the project used when tracking results. |

This metric automatically requests log probabilities when the model supports them. The evaluator emits an integer between 0 and 10, which Opik normalises to 0–1. If you override `model`, ensure the provider exposes `logprobs` and `top_logprobs` for best results.
