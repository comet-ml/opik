# Agent Task Completion Judge

`AgentTaskCompletionJudge` reviews an agent run (often a natural-language summary of what happened) and decides whether the high-level objective was met. It is particularly helpful for multi-step agents where success cannot be inferred from the final response alone.

```python title="Did the agent finish the job?"
from opik.evaluation.metrics import AgentTaskCompletionJudge

metric = AgentTaskCompletionJudge()

payload = """TASK: Extract company name, address, and tax ID from the invoice.
OUTCOME: Agent retrieved company name and address but failed to extract the tax ID.
"""

score = metric.score(output=payload)

print(score.value)  # 0.0–1.0 after normalisation
print(score.reason)
```

## Inputs

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `output` | `str` | **Yes** | Payload describing the task, evidence, and outcome for the judge. |

## Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | `gpt-5-nano` | Switch to heavier evaluators for complex workflows. |
| `temperature` | `0.0` | Increase slightly if you want more creative feedback. |
| `track` | `True` | Toggle evaluation logging. |
| `project_name` | `None` | Override project for logging. |

The evaluator returns an integer between 0 and 10; Opik divides it by 10 so `score.value` falls in the 0.0–1.0 range, while `score.reason` summarises which sub-tasks were completed or missed.
