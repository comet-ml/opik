# Agent Tool Correctness Judge

`AgentToolCorrectnessJudge` checks if an agent called the right tools with valid arguments and interpreted the outputs accurately. It’s invaluable for diagnosing production agents that orchestrate APIs, databases, or internal services.

```python title="Inspect tool usage"
from opik.evaluation.metrics import AgentToolCorrectnessJudge

payload = """TOOL weather_api(city='Paris') -> 12°C and raining.
AGENT: Responded "Sunny and warm".
"""

metric = AgentToolCorrectnessJudge()
score = metric.score(output=payload)

print(score.value)   # 0.0–1.0 after normalisation
print(score.reason)
```

## Inputs

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `output` | `str` | **Yes** | Payload describing the task, tool calls, and observed behaviour. |

## Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | `gpt-5-nano` | Upgrade to a larger evaluator if analysing lengthy traces. |
| `temperature` | `0.0` | Keep low for repeatable scoring. |
| `track` | `True` | Controls Opik tracking. |
| `project_name` | `None` | Override logging destination. |

The judge emits an integer between 0 and 10 (scaled to 0–1 by Opik); read `score.reason` to pinpoint incorrect calls, missing validations, or misinterpreted outputs.
