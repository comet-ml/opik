# Dialogue Helpfulness Judge

`DialogueHelpfulnessJudge` inspects the latest assistant reply in the context of preceding turns. It rewards responses that acknowledge the user’s request, use the available context, and offer actionable guidance.

```python title="Scoring a support reply"
from opik.evaluation.metrics import DialogueHelpfulnessJudge

turns = """USER: My VPN disconnects every 5 minutes.\nASSISTANT: Try reinstalling the client.\nUSER: I already did.\n"""

metric = DialogueHelpfulnessJudge()
score = metric.score(
    input=turns,
    output="Can you send logs? I'll escalate to network engineering.",
)

print(score.value)
print(score.reason)
```
