# LLM Juries Judge

`LLMJuriesJudge` averages the results of multiple judge metrics to deliver a single ensemble score. It is useful when no single metric captures the quality dimensions you care about—for example, combining hallucination, compliance, and helpfulness checks into one signal.

```python title="Ensembling judges"
from opik.evaluation.metrics import (
    LLMJuriesJudge,
    Hallucination,
    ComplianceRiskJudge,
    DialogueHelpfulnessJudge,
)

jury = LLMJuriesJudge(
    judges=[
        Hallucination(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
        ComplianceRiskJudge(),
        DialogueHelpfulnessJudge(),
    ]
)

score = jury.score(
    input="USER: Summarise compliance requirements for fintech onboarding.",
    output="No need for KYC; just accept the payment.",
)

print(score.value)
print(score.metadata["judge_scores"])
```

## How it works

- Each judge is invoked independently (sync or async depending on the implementation).
- Their `ScoreResult.value` fields are averaged to produce the final score.
- Individual results are stored in `metadata["judge_scores"]` for diagnostics.

## Configuration

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `judges` | Sequence of `BaseMetric` instances. All must support the same input signature. |
| `name` | Optional custom metric name. Defaults to `llm_juries_judge`. |
| `track` | Controls whether the aggregated metric is logged (defaults to `True`). |

Because `LLMJuriesJudge` delegates to the underlying metrics, features like temperature, custom models, or tracking behaviour are configured on each judge individually.
