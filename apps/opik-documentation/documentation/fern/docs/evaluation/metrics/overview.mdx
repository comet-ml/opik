# Overview

Opik provides a set of built-in evaluation metrics that you can mix and match to evaluate LLM behaviour. These metrics are broken down into two main categories:

1. **Heuristic metrics** – deterministic checks that rely on rules, statistics, or classical NLP algorithms.
2. **LLM as a Judge metrics** – delegate scoring to an LLM so you can capture semantic, task-specific, or conversation-level quality signals.

Heuristic metrics are ideal when you need reproducible checks such as exact matching, regex validation, or similarity scores against a reference. LLM as a Judge metrics are useful when you want richer qualitative feedback (hallucination detection, helpfulness, summarisation quality, regulatory risk, etc.).

## Customizing LLM as a Judge metrics

By default, Opik uses GPT-5-nano from OpenAI as the LLM to evaluate the output of other LLMs. However, you can easily switch to another LLM provider by specifying a different `model` parameter.

<CodeBlocks>
```python title="Python" language="python"
from opik.evaluation.metrics import Hallucination

metric = Hallucination(model="bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0")

metric.score(
input="What is the capital of France?",
output="The capital of France is Paris. It is famous for its iconic Eiffel Tower and rich cultural heritage.",
)

````

```typescript title="TypeScript" language="typescript"
import { Hallucination } from 'opik';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

// Using model ID string (simplest approach)
const metric1 = new Hallucination({ model: 'gpt-4o' });
const metric2 = new Hallucination({ model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest' });
const metric3 = new Hallucination({ model: 'gemini-2.0-flash' });

// With generation parameters (temperature, seed, maxTokens)
const metric4 = new Hallucination({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  temperature: 0.3,
  seed: 42
});

// Using custom LanguageModel instance for provider-specific configuration
const customModel = openai('gpt-4o', {
  structuredOutputs: true
});
const metric5 = new Hallucination({ model: customModel });

// Score using the metric
await metric4.score({
    input: "What is the capital of France?",
    output: "The capital of France is Paris. It is famous for its iconic Eiffel Tower and rich cultural heritage.",
});
````

</CodeBlocks>

For **Python**, this functionality is based on LiteLLM framework. You can find a full list of supported LLM providers and how to configure them in the [LiteLLM Providers](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) guide.

For **TypeScript**, the SDK integrates with the Vercel AI SDK. You can use model ID strings for simplicity or LanguageModel instances for advanced configuration. See the [Models documentation](/reference/typescript-sdk/evaluation/models) for more details.
