# Prompt Uncertainty

Prompt uncertainty scoring helps you triage risky or underspecified user requests before they reach your production model. `PromptUncertaintyJudge` highlights missing context or conflicting instructions that could confuse an assistant.

Run the judge on raw prompts to decide whether to request clarification, route to a human, or fan out to more capable models.

```python title="Triaging tricky prompts"
from opik.evaluation.metrics import PromptUncertaintyJudge

prompt = (
    "Summarise the attached 200-page legal agreement into a single bullet, "
    "guaranteeing there are no omissions."
)

uncertainty = PromptUncertaintyJudge().score(input=prompt)

print(uncertainty.value, uncertainty.reason)
```

## Inputs

The judge accepts a single string via the `input` keyword. You can optionally pass additional metadata (dataset row contents, prompt IDs) via keyword arguments – these will be forwarded to the underlying base metric for tracking.

## Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | `gpt-5-nano` | Swap to any LiteLLM chat model if you need a larger evaluator. |
| `temperature` | `0.0` | Lower values improve reproducibility; higher values explore more interpretations. |
| `track` | `True` | Disable to skip logging evaluations. |
| `project_name` | `None` | Override the project when logging results. |

The evaluator emits an integer between 0 and 10 (normalised to 0–1 by Opik). Inspect the `reason` text for rationale and per-criterion feedback, and trigger follow-up automations when scores cross a threshold.
