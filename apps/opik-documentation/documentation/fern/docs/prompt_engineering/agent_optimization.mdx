Ensuring that an agent is performing well is a complex task, there are a lot of moving
parts from controlling the data flow to tweaking specific prompts.

The most challenging aspect of optimizing agents is that a change in the orchestrator prompt
or any of the tool prompts can lead to a change in other parts of the system as everything is
connected. As a result improving the performance of an agent is more similar to optimizing
a complex inter-dependant system than simply doing some prompt engineering
