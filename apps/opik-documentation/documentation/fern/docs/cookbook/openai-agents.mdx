# Using Opik with OpenAI Agents

Opik integrates with OpenAI Agents to provide a simple way to log traces and analyse for all OpenAI LLM calls. This works for all OpenAI models, including if you are using the streaming API.


## Creating an account on Comet.com

[Comet](https://www.comet.com/site?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=openai&utm_campaign=opik) provides a hosted version of the Opik platform, [simply create an account](https://www.comet.com/signup?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=openai&utm_campaign=opik) and grab your API Key.

> You can also run the Opik platform locally, see the [installation guide](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/self-host/overview/?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=openai&utm_campaign=opik) for more information.


```python
%pip install --upgrade opik openai-agents
```


```python
import opik

opik.configure(use_local=False)
```

## Preparing our environment

First, we will set up our OpenAI API keys.


```python
import os
import getpass

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your OpenAI API key: ")
```

## Logging traces

In order to log traces to Opik, we need to wrap our OpenAI calls with the `track_openai` function:


```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents import set_trace_processors
from opik.integrations.openai.agents import OpikTracingProcessor

os.environ["OPIK_PROJECT_NAME"] = "openai-agents-demo"

set_trace_processors(processors=[OpikTracingProcessor()])
```


```python
# Create and run your agent
agent = Agent(
    name="Creative Assistant", 
    instructions="You are a creative writing assistant that helps users with poetry and creative content.",
    model="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Use async Runner.run() instead of run_sync() in Jupyter notebooks
result = await Runner.run(agent, "Write a haiku about recursion in programming.")
print(result.final_output)
```

## Using it with the `track` decorator

If you have multiple steps in your LLM pipeline, you can use the `track` decorator to log the traces for each step. If OpenAI is called within one of these steps, the LLM call with be associated with that corresponding step:


```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool
from opik import track

@function_tool
def calculate_average(numbers: list[float]) -> float:
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

@function_tool  
def get_recommendation(topic: str, user_level: str) -> str:
    recommendations = {
        "python": {
            "beginner": "Start with Python.org's tutorial, then try Python Crash Course book. Practice with simple scripts and built-in functions.",
            "intermediate": "Explore frameworks like Flask/Django, learn about decorators, context managers, and dive into Python's data structures.",
            "advanced": "Study Python internals, contribute to open source, learn about metaclasses, and explore performance optimization."
        },
        "machine learning": {
            "beginner": "Start with Andrew Ng's Coursera course, learn basic statistics, and try scikit-learn with simple datasets.",
            "intermediate": "Dive into deep learning with TensorFlow/PyTorch, study different algorithms, and work on real projects.",
            "advanced": "Research latest papers, implement algorithms from scratch, and contribute to ML frameworks."
        }
    }
    
    topic_lower = topic.lower()
    level_lower = user_level.lower()
    
    if topic_lower in recommendations and level_lower in recommendations[topic_lower]:
        return recommendations[topic_lower][level_lower]
    else:
        return f"For {topic} at {user_level} level: Focus on fundamentals, practice regularly, and build projects to apply your knowledge."

def create_advanced_agent():
    """Create an advanced agent with tools and comprehensive instructions."""
    instructions = """
    You are an expert programming tutor and learning advisor. You have access to tools that help you:

    Your role:
    - Help users learn programming concepts effectively
    - Provide clear, beginner-friendly explanations when needed
    - Use your tools when appropriate to give concrete help
    - Offer structured learning paths and resources
    - Be encouraging and supportive
    
    When users ask about:
    - Programming languages: Use get_recommendation to provide tailored advice
    - Performance or scores: Use calculate_average if numbers are involved
    - Learning paths: Combine your knowledge with tool-based recommendations
    
    Always explain your reasoning and make your responses educational.
    """
    
    return Agent(
        name="AdvancedProgrammingTutor",
        instructions=instructions,
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        tools=[calculate_average, get_recommendation]
    )

advanced_agent = create_advanced_agent()

advanced_queries = [
    "I'm new to Python programming. Can you tell me about it?",
    "I got these test scores: 85, 92, 78, 96, 88. What's my average and how am I doing?",
    "I know some Python basics but want to learn machine learning. What should I do next?",
    "Can you help me calculate the average of these response times: 1.2, 0.8, 1.5, 0.9, 1.1 seconds? And tell me if that's good performance?"
]

for i, query in enumerate(advanced_queries, 1):
    print(f"\nüìù Query {i}: {query}")
    result = await Runner.run(advanced_agent, query)
    print(f"ü§ñ Response: {result.final_output}")
    print("=" * 80)
```

The trace can now be viewed in the UI:
