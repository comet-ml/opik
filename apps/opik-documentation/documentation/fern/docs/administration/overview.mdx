Opik Cloud and Enterprise include administration features for teams and organizations, including:

- **Role-based access control**: Assign granular permissions at the organization and workspace level
- **Single sign-on (SSO)**: Authenticate users via SAML or OIDC with your identity provider
- **Workspace isolation**: Separate projects and data across teams with independent access controls
- **Service accounts**: Create API keys for CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows
- **User management**: Invite team members, assign roles, and manage access from a central dashboard
- **JWT authentication**: Integrate Opik into existing systems with token-based auth

## Key concepts

Opik uses a hierarchical structure to organize users and data:

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Organization** | Your company or team. Contains all users, workspaces, and billing settings. |
| **Workspace** | A container for projects. Users can belong to multiple workspaces with different roles in each. |
| **Project** | A container for traces. Experiments and datasets live at the workspace level. |
| **Organization Role** | Controls organization-wide permissions (e.g., Admin can manage billing and users). |
| **Workspace Role** | Controls what a user can do within a specific workspace (e.g., Editor can create projects). |

Here's how these concepts relate:

    Org[Organization] --> Users[Users + Org Roles]
    Org --> Settings[Settings]
    Org --> WS[Workspaces]
    WS --> WSA[Workspace A]
    WS --> WSB[Workspace B]
    WSA --> MembersA[Members + Roles]
    WSA --> ProjectsA[Projects]
    WSB --> MembersB[Members + Roles]
    WSB --> ProjectsB[Projects]
```

<Tip>
We recommend creating one workspace per team. This keeps projects organized and allows you to assign different roles to team members based on their responsibilities.
