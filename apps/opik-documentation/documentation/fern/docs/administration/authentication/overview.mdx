Opik supports multiple authentication methods to integrate with your organization's identity management infrastructure. This guide helps you understand the available options and choose the right approach for your needs.

<Note>
Authentication features are available on Enterprise plans. These features are not available in open-source deployments. [Reach out](https://www.comet.com/site/about-us/contact-us/) if you want to enable SSO or JWT authentication for your Opik deployment.
</Note>

## Authentication methods

Opik supports multiple authentication methods for enterprise organizations. For configurable UI access, you can set up SAML SSO or OIDC SSO to integrate with your identity provider. Other available methods include base authentication (username/password), Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, and LDAP (for on-premises deployments).
JWT Authentication is available separately for SDK and programmatic access. Unlike SAML SSO and OIDC SSO, JWT Authentication is designed for service-to-service and API integrations, not for user interface login.

| Method | Best for | Key features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SAML SSO** | Organizations with enterprise IdPs (Okta, Azure AD, etc.) | Workspace sync, attribute mapping, broad IdP support |
| **OIDC SSO** | Organizations using OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect | Simpler setup, token-based, modern protocol |
| **JWT Authentication** | Programmatic access, custom auth flows | Flexible integration, JWKS support, service-to-service auth |

## Choosing an authentication method

Use this decision guide to select the right authentication method:

### Use SAML SSO when:

- Your organization already uses an enterprise identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, etc.)
- You need automatic workspace assignment based on user attributes/groups
- You require centralized user lifecycle management (auto-provisioning/deprovisioning)
- Your security policies mandate SAML-based authentication

### Use OIDC SSO when:

- Your identity provider supports OpenID Connect but not SAML
- You prefer a simpler, more modern protocol
- You're using a cloud-native identity solution
- You don't need attribute-based workspace sync

### Use JWT Authentication when:

- You need programmatic/API access from backend services
- You're building custom authentication flows
- You want to integrate with existing JWT-based systems
- You need service-to-service authentication

<Tip>
**Multiple methods**: You can configure multiple authentication methods for your organization. For example, use SAML for human users and JWT for service accounts.
</Tip>

## Common prerequisites

Before configuring any authentication method, ensure you have:

1. **Admin access**: You must be an organization administrator.
2. **Enterprise plan**: SSO features require an Enterprise subscription.
3. **Domain ownership**: You should control the email domain(s) you want to use for SSO.
4. **IdP access** (for SSO): Admin access to your identity provider to configure the integration.

## Security considerations

### Domain verification

When configuring SSO, you associate email domains with your organization. This ensures:

- Users with those email domains are directed to your SSO configuration.
- Only users who authenticate through your IdP can access the organization.

<Warning>
**Important**: Ensure you only configure domains you own or control. Misconfigured domains could prevent legitimate users from accessing their accounts.
</Warning>

### Certificate management

For SAML authentication:

- Store IdP certificates securely.
- Monitor certificate expiration dates.
- Plan for certificate rotation to avoid authentication disruptions.

### Key rotation

For JWT authentication:

- Use JWKS endpoints when possible for automatic key rotation.
- If using static keys (on-prem only), establish a key rotation schedule.
- Monitor JWKS endpoint availability.

## Troubleshooting

Common authentication issues and solutions:

| Issue | Possible causes | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User can't log in via SSO | Domain not configured, IdP misconfigured | Verify domain settings, check IdP configuration |
| User lands in wrong organization | Multiple SSO configs for same domain | Review domain-to-organization mappings |
| Workspace sync not working | Attribute mapping incorrect | Verify IdP sends expected attributes |
| JWT validation fails | Key mismatch, expired token, wrong issuer | Check JWKS endpoint, verify token claims |
| Certificate errors | Expired or wrong certificate | Update certificate in SSO configuration |
