Workspace preferences let workspace owners configure behavior settings that apply across the entire workspace.

<Note>
Only workspace owners can modify these preferences. See [Roles and Permissions](/administration/roles_and_permissions) for details.

## Thread Timeout

Set how long a thread stays active before switching to inactive. Options range from 5 minutes up to 1 hour.

Once inactive, you can log feedback scores via the UI, SDK, or online evaluation rules. Sending a new message reactivates the thread and clears all scores, tags, and comments.

**Default:** 5 minutes

## Data Truncation in Tables

Control whether long text values are truncated in table views. When enabled, long values show an ellipsis (...) and you can click to view the full content.

**Default:** Enabled

<Warning>
Disabling truncation displays full content in tables but limits pagination to 10 items per page. Large amounts of data may cause slower page loading and increased memory usage.
</Warning>
