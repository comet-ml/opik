## Overview

Workspace members management allows workspace owners to view members, invite new users, remove users, and assign workspace roles.

## Accessing Workspace Members

1. Navigate to your workspace in Opik
2. Click on **Configuration** in the left sidebar
3. Select the **Members** tab

<Note>
The Members tab is only visible to workspace owners.
</Note>

## Viewing Workspace Members

The members table displays:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Name / Username** | The member's display name or username |
| **Email** | The member's email address |
| **Joined** | When the member joined the workspace |
| **Workspace role** | The member's role in this workspace |

## Adding Users

To invite new users:

1. Click the **Add users** button in the top-right corner
2. Search for users by username or email address
3. Select the user(s) you want to add
4. Click to confirm the invitation

**Add existing organization members:**
- Search by username to find users already in your organization
- They are immediately added to the workspace

<Note>
Username search only returns users who are already members of your organization.
</Note>

**Invite by email:**
- Enter an email address for someone not yet in the organization
- They'll receive an email invitation
- Once they accept and join the organization, they're added to the workspace

<Tip>
Users invited by email appear with their email address until they accept and create an account.
</Tip>

## Changing a Member's Role

1. Find the member in the table
2. Click on their current role in the **Workspace role** column
3. Select a new role from the dropdown
4. The change takes effect immediately

<Warning>
Organization admins always have full access to all workspaces, regardless of their assigned workspace role.
</Warning>

For details on available roles and permissions, see [Roles and Permissions](/administration/roles_and_permissions).

## Removing Members

To remove a member from the workspace:

1. Find the member in the table
2. Click the actions menu (three dots) on their row
3. Select **Remove from workspace**
4. Confirm the removal

<Warning>
Removed users lose access immediately. Their historical data (traces, experiments) is retained. You cannot remove yourself from a workspace.
</Warning>
