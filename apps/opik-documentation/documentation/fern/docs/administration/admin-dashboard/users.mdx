The Users section in the Admin Dashboard allows organization administrators to view all users, change organization roles, and remove users from the organization.

## Viewing Users

To view all users in your organization:

1. Navigate to the [Admin Dashboard](/administration/admin-dashboard/overview)
2. Click on **Users** in the sidebar

The list shows each user's name, email, organization role, and when they joined.

## Changing Organization Roles

Organization roles determine high-level access across the organization. See [Roles and Permissions](/administration/roles_and_permissions) for details on available roles.

To change a user's organization role:

1. Navigate to the **Users** section in the Admin Dashboard
2. Find the user whose role you want to change
3. Click on the role dropdown
4. Select the new role

<Warning>
You cannot change your own organization role. Another admin must make changes to your role. There must always be at least one admin in the organization.
</Warning>

## Removing Users

To remove a user from your organization:

1. Navigate to the **Users** section in the Admin Dashboard
2. Find the user you want to remove
3. Click the **more options** menu (three dots)
4. Select **Remove from organization**
5. Confirm the removal

<Warning>
Removing a user revokes all their access immediately. Their historical data (traces, experiments) is retained. You cannot remove yourself or the last admin from the organization.
</Warning>
