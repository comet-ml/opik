Workspaces group related projects together within your organization. Each workspace has its own members, roles, and isolated data (traces, experiments, datasets).

## Viewing Workspaces

To view all workspaces in your organization:

1. Navigate to the [Admin Dashboard](/administration/admin-dashboard/overview)
2. Click on **Workspaces** in the sidebar

The list shows each workspace's name, member count, and creation date.

## Creating a Workspace

1. Navigate to the **Workspaces** section in the Admin Dashboard
2. Click **Create Workspace**
3. Enter a **name** for the workspace
4. Click **Create**

<Tip>
Use clear, descriptive names. Examples: `production`, `staging`, `research-team`.
</Tip>

## Deleting a Workspace

<Warning>
Deleting a workspace permanently removes all data within it, including projects, traces, experiments, and datasets. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

To delete a workspace:

1. Navigate to the **Workspaces** section in the Admin Dashboard
2. Find the workspace you want to delete
3. Click the **more options** menu (three dots)
4. Select **Delete**
5. Confirm the deletion by typing the workspace name

You cannot delete the only workspace in the organization.
