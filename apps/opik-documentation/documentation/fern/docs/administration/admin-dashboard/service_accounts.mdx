Service accounts provide programmatic access to Opik for automated systems, CI/CD pipelines, and integrations. Unlike user accounts, service accounts use API keys for authentication and don't require interactive login.

<Note>
Service Accounts is available on Opik Cloud and Enterprise plans. This feature is not available in open-source deployments. [Reach out](https://www.comet.com/site/about-us/contact-us/) if you want to enable this feature for your Opik deployment.
</Note>

## Creating a Service Account

1. Navigate to the [Admin Dashboard](/administration/admin-dashboard/overview)
2. Click on **Service Accounts** in the sidebar
3. Click **Create service account**
4. Enter a **name** for the service account
5. Optionally select a **default workspace**
6. Optionally select **authorized workspaces** to restrict access
7. Click **Create**

<Tip>
Use descriptive names that indicate the service account's purpose, such as `ci-pipeline-prod` or `monitoring-service`.
</Tip>

## Managing API Keys

Each service account can have multiple API keys. To manage keys:

1. Navigate to the **Service Accounts** section in the Admin Dashboard
2. Find the service account and click **Manage API keys**

From the API keys modal you can:

- **Add key**: Generate a new API key
- **Copy key**: Copy an existing key to clipboard
- **Delete key**: Remove a key (takes effect immediately)

<Warning>
API keys are only shown once when created. Copy and store them securely immediately. If you lose a key, you'll need to generate a new one.
</Warning>

## Deleting a Service Account

<Warning>
Deleting a service account immediately revokes all its API keys. Any systems using those keys will stop working.
</Warning>

1. Navigate to the **Service Accounts** section in the Admin Dashboard
2. Find the service account you want to delete
3. Click the **delete** action
4. Confirm the deletion

## Using Service Account API Keys

Configure the Opik SDK with a service account API key:

```python
import opik

# Using environment variables (recommended)
# export OPIK_API_KEY=your-service-account-api-key
# export OPIK_WORKSPACE=your-workspace
client = opik.Opik()

# Or configure directly
client = opik.Opik(
    api_key="your-service-account-api-key",
    workspace="your-workspace"
)
```
