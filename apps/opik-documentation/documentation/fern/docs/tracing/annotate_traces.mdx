Logging user feedback and scoring traces is a crucial aspect of evaluating and improving your agent.
By systematically recording qualitative or quantitative feedback on specific interactions or entire
conversation flows, you can:

1. Track performance over time
2. Identify areas for improvement
3. Compare different model versions or prompts
4. Gather data for fine-tuning or retraining
5. Provide stakeholders with concrete metrics on system effectiveness

## Logging user feedback using the SDK

You can use the SDKs to log user feedback and score traces:

<CodeBlocks>
```typescript title="Typescript SDK" language="typescript"
import { Opik } from "opik";

const client = new Opik();

// Create a new trace
const trace = client.trace({
name: "my_trace",
input: { "input": "Hi!" },
output: { "output": "Hello!" },
});

// Log feedback scores to an existing trace
await client.logTracesFeedbackScores([
{ id: trace.id, name: "overall_quality", value: 0.9, reason: "Good answer" },
{ id: trace.id, name: "coherence", value: 0.8 }
]);

```

```python title="Python Function Decorator" language="python"
import opik
from opik import opik_context

@opik.track
def my_function():
  opik_context.update_current_trace(
    feedback_scores=[
      {
        "name": "user_feedback",
        "value": 1,
        "reason": "Good answer" # Optional
      }
    ]
  )

  return "Hello, world!"
```

```python title="Python SDK" language="python"
import opik

client = opik.Opik()

# Log feedback scores to an existing trace
client.log_traces_feedback_scores(
  feedback_scores=[
    {"id": "trace_id", "name": "user_feedback", "value": 1},
    {"id": "trace_id", "name": "accuracy", "value": 1, "reason": "Good answer"} # Optional reason score
  ]
)

# Log feedback score to a new trace
client.trace(
  name="my_trace",
  input={"input": "Hi!"},
  output={"output": "Hello!"},
  feedback_scores=[
    {"name": "user_feedback", "value": 1, "reason": "Good answer"}
  ]
)
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Annotating Traces through the UI

To annotate traces through the UI, you can navigate to the trace you want to annotate in the traces
page and click on the `Annotate` button. This will open a sidebar where you can add annotations to
the trace.

You can annotate both traces and spans through the UI, make sure you have selected the correct span
in the sidebar.

</Frame>

Once a feedback scores has been provided, you can also add a reason to explain why this particular
score was provided. This is useful to add additional context to the score.

If multiple team members are annotating the same trace, you can see the annotations of each team
member in the UI in the `Feedback scores` section. The average score will be displayed at a trace
and trace level.

<Tip>
  If you want a more dedicated annotation interface, you can use the [Annotation Queues](/evaluation/annotation_queues)
  feature.
</Tip>

## Online evaluation

You don't need to manually annotate each trace to measure the performance of your agents! By using
Opik's [online evaluation feature](/production/rules), you can define LLM as a Judge metrics that
will automatically score all, or a subset, of your production traces.

## Next steps

You can go one step further and:

1. [Create an offline evaluation](/evaluation/evaluate_prompt) to evaluate your agent before it is
   deployed to production
2. [Score your agent in production](/production/rules) to track and catch specific issues with your
   agent
3. [Use annotation queues](/evaluation/annotation_queues) to organize your traces for review and
   labeling by your team of experts
4. [Checkout our LLM as a Judge metrics](/evaluation/metrics/overview)
