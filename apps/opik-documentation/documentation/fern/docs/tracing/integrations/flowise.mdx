Flowise AI is a visual LLM builder that allows you to create AI agents and workflows through a drag-and-drop interface. With Opik integration, you can analyze and troubleshoot your chatflows and agentflows to improve performance and user experience.

<Tip>
  This is a native UI integration that works directly within the Flowise AI interface. No Python code is required to set
  up the integration.

### 3. Verify Integration

Once configured, you can analyze your chatflows and agentflows using the Opik UI dashboard. The integration will automatically start tracking:

- User interactions
- Agent responses
- Performance metrics
- Error rates
- Conversation flows

## What Gets Tracked

When you enable the Opik integration in Flowise AI, the following data is automatically captured:

- **Chatflow/Agentflow executions**: Complete workflow runs with inputs and outputs
- **User interactions**: All user messages and system responses
- **Performance metrics**: Response times and execution durations
- **Error tracking**: Any failures or exceptions during execution
- **Conversation context**: Full conversation history and flow state

## Viewing Data in Opik

After setting up the integration, you can view your Flowise AI data in the Opik dashboard:

1. **Traces**: Each chatflow or agentflow execution creates a trace
2. **Spans**: Individual steps and interactions within workflows
3. **Metrics**: Performance and usage statistics
4. **Feedback**: Manual annotations and evaluations

## Next Steps

After setting up the Flowise AI integration:

1. **Test the Integration**: Run a few test chatflows to verify data is being captured
2. **Explore Analytics**: Use the Opik dashboard to analyze your workflow performance
3. **Set Up Monitoring**: Configure alerts for performance issues or errors
4. **Optimize Workflows**: Use insights to improve your AI applications
