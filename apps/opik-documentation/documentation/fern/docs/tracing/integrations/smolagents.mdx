Smolagents is a framework from HuggingFace that allows you to create AI agents
with various capabilities. The framework provides a simple way to build agents
that can perform tasks like coding, searching the web, and more.

Opik integrates seamlessly with Smolagents through OpenTelemetry, allowing you
to trace and monitor your agent executions in detail.

## Getting started

First, ensure you have both `opik` and `smolagents` packages installed with the
telemetry components:

```bash
pip install opik 'smolagents[telemetry,toolkit]'
```

In addition, you can configure Opik using the `opik configure` command:

```bash
opik configure
```

Or programmatically:

```python
import opik
opik.configure(use_local=False)  # Set to True if using a local Opik server
```

## Setting up OpenTelemetry for SmolAgents

To enable tracing of your SmolAgents execution with Opik, you need to set up
OpenTelemetry. First, configure the necessary environment variables:

```python
import opik
import os

opik_config = opik.config.get_from_user_inputs()

# Set the OpenTelemetry endpoint
endpoint = "https://www.comet.com/opik/api/v1/private/otel"
os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT"] = endpoint

# Set the headers with authorization and project information
headers = (
    f"Authorization={opik_config.api_key},"
    f"projectName={opik_config.project_name},"
    f"Comet-Workspace={opik_config.workspace}"
)
os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS"] = headers
```

<Tip>
  The `projectName` and `Comet-Workspace` headers are optional and can be set to `Default` and `default` respectively.
  If you are using the self-hosted version of Opik, you will need to update the endpoint URL. You can learn more about
  this in the [Opik OpenTelemetry documentation](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/opentelemetry/overview).
</Tip>

Next, set up the instrumentation for SmolAgents:

```python
# Import telemetry components
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor

# Import SmolAgents instrumentation
from openinference.instrumentation.smolagents import (
    SmolagentsInstrumentor
)

# Import OTLP exporter
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import (
    OTLPSpanExporter
)

# Set up the tracer provider with span processor
trace_provider = TracerProvider()
trace_provider.add_span_processor(
    SimpleSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())
)

# Instrument SmolAgents
SmolagentsInstrumentor().instrument(tracer_provider=trace_provider)
```

## Using SmolAgents with Opik

After setting up the instrumentation, you can use SmolAgents as usual. All agent
executions will be automatically traced and sent to Opik:

```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, WebSearchTool, OpenAIServerModel

model = OpenAIServerModel(
    model_id="gpt-4o",
)

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[WebSearchTool()],
    model=model,
    stream_outputs=True
)

agent.run("How many seconds would it take for a leopard at full speed to run through Pont des Arts?")
```

With the OpenTelemetry configuration in place, all agent executions, including
intermediate steps and tool usage, will be logged in Opik. This allows you to visualize the entire execution flow, examine inputs and outputs, and analyze the performance of your agents.

## Features

The Opik integration with SmolAgents provides:

1. Detailed tracing of agent execution flows
2. Visualization of tool calls and their results
3. Tracking of LLM inputs and outputs
4. Performance metrics for agent executions
