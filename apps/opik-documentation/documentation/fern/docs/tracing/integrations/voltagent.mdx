---

VoltAgent is an agent framework designed to simplify the creation and management of AI agents with built-in support for tool usage, memory management, and multi-agent coordination. It provides a flexible architecture for building production-ready AI agent systems.

VoltAgent's primary advantage is its modular design that allows developers to easily create, customize, and deploy AI agents with comprehensive tool integration and memory capabilities.


## Getting started

To use the VoltAgent integration with Opik, you will need to have VoltAgent and the required OpenTelemetry packages installed:

```bash
npm install @voltagent/core @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-trace @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http
```

## Environment configuration

Configure your environment variables based on your Opik deployment:

<Tabs>
    <Tab value="Opik Cloud" title="Opik Cloud">
        If you are using Opik Cloud, you will need to set the following
        environment variables:
            
        ```bash wordWrap
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://www.comet.com/opik/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default'
        ```

        <Tip>
            To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the
            `projectName` parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
            environment variable:

            ```bash wordWrap
            export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default,projectName=<your-project-name>'
            ```

            You can also update the `Comet-Workspace` parameter to a different
            value if you would like to log the data to a different workspace.
        </Tip>
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Enterprise deployment" title="Enterprise deployment">
        If you are using an Enterprise deployment of Opik, you will need to set the following
        environment variables:

        ```bash wordWrap
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://<comet-deployment-url>/opik/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default'
        ```

        <Tip>
            To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the
            `projectName` parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
            environment variable:

            ```bash wordWrap
            export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default,projectName=<your-project-name>'
            ```

            You can also update the `Comet-Workspace` parameter to a different
            value if you would like to log the data to a different workspace.
        </Tip>
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Self-hosted instance" title="Self-hosted instance">

    If you are self-hosting Opik, you will need to set the following environment
    variables:

    ```bash
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5173/api/v1/private/otel
    ```

    <Tip>
        To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the `projectName`
        parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable:

        ```bash
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='projectName=<your-project-name>'
        ```

    </Tip>
    </Tab>

## Using Opik with VoltAgent

Set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation for VoltAgent:

```typescript
import { trace, SpanStatusCode } from "@opentelemetry/api";
import { NodeTracerProvider } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node";
import { BatchSpanProcessor } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base";
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http";

// Configure the OTLP exporter
const otlpExporter = new OTLPTraceExporter();

// Set up the tracer provider
const provider = new NodeTracerProvider();
provider.addSpanProcessor(new BatchSpanProcessor(otlpExporter));
provider.register();

// Your VoltAgent code will now automatically send traces to Opik
import { Agent } from "@voltagent/core";

const agent = new Agent();
// ... agent configuration
```
