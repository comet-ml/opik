[Guardrails AI](https://github.com/guardrails-ai/guardrails) is a framework for validating the inputs and outputs

For this guide we will use a simple example that logs guardrails validation steps as traces to Opik, providing them with the validation result tags.

First, ensure you have both `opik` and `guardrails-ai` installed:

```bash
pip install opik guardrails-ai
```

We will also need to install the guardrails check for politeness from the Guardrails Hub

```bash
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/politeness_check
```

## Logging validation traces

In order to log traces to Opik, you will need to call the track the Guard object with `track_guardrails` function.

```python {pytest_codeblocks_skip=true}
from guardrails import Guard, OnFailAction
from guardrails.hub import PolitenessCheck

from opik.integrations.guardrails import track_guardrails

politeness_check = PolitenessCheck(
    llm_callable="gpt-3.5-turbo", on_fail=OnFailAction.NOOP
)

guard: Guard = Guard().use_many(politeness_check)
guard = track_guardrails(guard, project_name="guardrails-integration-example")

guard.validate(
    "Would you be so kind to pass me a cup of tea?",
)
guard.validate(
    "Shut your mouth up and give me the tea.",
);
```

Every validation will now be logged to Opik as a trace

The trace will now be viewable in the Opik platform:
