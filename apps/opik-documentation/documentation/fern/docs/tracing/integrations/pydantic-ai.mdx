[Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) is a Python agent framework designed to
build production grade applications with Generative AI.

Pydantic AI's primary advantage is its integration of Pydantic's type-safe data
validation, ensuring structured and reliable responses in AI applications.

## Account Setup

[Comet](https://www.comet.com/site?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=pydantic-ai&utm_campaign=opik) provides a hosted version of the Opik platform, [simply create an account](https://www.comet.com/signup?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=pydantic-ai&utm_campaign=opik) and grab your API Key.

> You can also run the Opik platform locally, see the [installation guide](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/self-host/overview/?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=pydantic-ai&utm_campaign=opik) for more information.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the Pydantic AI integration with Opik, you will need to have Pydantic AI
and logfire installed:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pydantic-ai logfire 'logfire[httpx]'
```

### Configuring Pydantic AI

In order to use Pydantic AI, you will need to configure your LLM provider API keys. For this example, we'll use OpenAI. You can [find or create your API keys in these pages](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys):

You can set them as environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Or set them programmatically:

```python
import os
import getpass

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your OpenAI API key: ")
```

### Configuring OpenTelemetry

You will need to set the following environment variables to make
sure the data is logged to Opik:

<Tabs>
    <Tab value="Opik Cloud" title="Opik Cloud">
        If you are using Opik Cloud, you will need to set the following environment
        variables:
            
        ```bash
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://www.comet.com/opik/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default'
        export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none
        ```

        <Tip>
            To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the `projectName` parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable:

            ```bash
            export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default,projectName=<your-project-name>'
            ```

            You can also update the `Comet-Workspace` parameter to a different value if you would like to log the data
            to a different workspace.
        </Tip>
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Enterprise deployment" title="Enterprise deployment">
        If you are using an Enterprise deployment of Opik, you will need to set the following
        environment variables:

        ```bash wordWrap
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://<comet-deployment-url>/opik/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default'
        export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none
        ```

        <Tip>
            To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the
            `projectName` parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
            environment variable:

            ```bash wordWrap
            export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default,projectName=<your-project-name>'
            ```

            You can also update the `Comet-Workspace` parameter to a different
            value if you would like to log the data to a different workspace.
        </Tip>
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Self-hosted instance" title="Self-hosted instance">

    If you are self-hosting Opik, you will need to set the following environment variables:

    ```bash
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5173/api/v1/private/otel
    export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none
    ```

    <Tip>
        To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the `projectName` parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable:

        ```bash
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='projectName=<your-project-name>'
        ```

    </Tip>
    </Tab>

## Using Opik with Pydantic AI

To track your Pydantic AI agents, you will need to configure logfire as this is
the framework used by Pydantic AI to enable tracing.

```python
import logfire

logfire.configure(
    send_to_logfire=False,
)
logfire.instrument_httpx(capture_all=True)
```

## Practical Example

Now that everything is configured, you can create and run Pydantic AI agents:

```python
import nest_asyncio
from pydantic_ai import Agent

# Enable async support in Jupyter notebooks
nest_asyncio.apply()

# Create a simple agent
agent = Agent(
    "openai:gpt-4o",
    system_prompt="Be concise, reply with one sentence.",
)

# Run the agent
result = agent.run_sync('Where does "hello world" come from?')
print(result.data)
```

  <img src="/img/cookbook/pydantic-ai_trace_cookbook.png" alt="Pydantic AI tracing" />
</Frame>

## Advanced usage

You can reduce the amount of data logged to Opik by setting `capture_all` to `False`:

```python
import logfire

logfire.configure(
    send_to_logfire=False,
)
logfire.instrument_httpx(capture_all=False)
```

When this parameter is set to `False`, we will not log the exact request made
to the LLM provider.
