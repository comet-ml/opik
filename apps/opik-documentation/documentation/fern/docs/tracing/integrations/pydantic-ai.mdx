[Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) is a Python agent framework designed to
build production grade applications with Generative AI.

Pydantic AI's primary advantage is its integration of Pydantic's type-safe data
validation, ensuring structured and reliable responses in AI applications.

## Getting started

To use the Pydantic AI integration with Opik, you will need to have Pydantic AI
and logfire installed:

```bash
pip install --upgrade --quiet pydantic-ai logfire 'logfire[httpx]'
```

In addition you will need to set the following environment variables to make
sure the data is logged to Opik:

<Tabs>
    <Tab value="Opik Cloud" title="Opik Cloud">
        If you are using Opik Cloud, you will need to set the following environment
        variables:
            
        ```bash
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://www.comet.com/opik/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default'
        ```

        <Tip>
            To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the `projectName` parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable:

            ```bash
            export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default,projectName=<your-project-name>'
            ```

            You can also update the `Comet-Workspace` parameter to a different value if you would like to log the data
            to a different workspace.
        </Tip>
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Self-hosted instance" title="Self-hosted instance">

    If you are self-hosting Opik, you will need to set the following environment variables:

    ```bash
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5173/api/v1/private/otel
    ```

    <Tip>
        To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the `projectName` parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable:

        ```bash
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='projectName=<your-project-name>'
        ```

    </Tip>
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Opik with Pydantic AI

To track your Pydantic AI agents, you will need to configure logfire as this is
the framework used by Pydantic AI to enable tracing.

```python
import logfire

logfire.configure(
    send_to_logfire=False,
)
logfire.instrument_httpx(capture_all=True)
```

This combined with the environment variables above will log your traces to Opik:

</Frame>

## Advanced usage

You can reduce the amount of data logged to Opik by setting `capture_all` to `False`:

```python
import logfire

logfire.configure(
    send_to_logfire=False,
)
logfire.instrument_httpx(capture_all=False)
```

When this parameter is set to `False`, we will not log the exact request made
to the LLM provider.
