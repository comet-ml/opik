[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) is a comprehensive multi-language framework for building, orchestrating, and deploying AI agents and multi-agent workflows with support for both Python and .NET implementations.

The framework provides everything from simple chat agents to complex multi-agent workflows with graph-based orchestration, built-in OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing and monitoring, and a flexible middleware system for request/response processing.

## Account Setup

[Comet](https://www.comet.com/site?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=agent-framework&utm_campaign=opik) provides a hosted version of the Opik platform, [simply create an account](https://www.comet.com/signup?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=agent-framework&utm_campaign=opik) and grab your API Key.

> You can also run the Opik platform locally, see the [installation guide](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/self-host/overview/?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=agent-framework&utm_campaign=opik) for more information.

## Getting started

To use the Microsoft Agent Framework integration with Opik, you will need to have the Agent Framework and the required OpenTelemetry packages installed:

```bash
pip install --pre agent-framework opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
```

In addition, you will need to set the following environment variables to configure OpenTelemetry to send data to Opik:

<Tabs>
    <Tab value="Opik Cloud" title="Opik Cloud">
        If you are using Opik Cloud, you will need to set the following
        environment variables:
            
        ```bash wordWrap
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://www.comet.com/opik/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default'
        ```

        <Tip>
            To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the
            `projectName` parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
            environment variable:

            ```bash wordWrap
            export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default,projectName=<your-project-name>'
            ```

            You can also update the `Comet-Workspace` parameter to a different
            value if you would like to log the data to a different workspace.
        </Tip>
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Enterprise deployment" title="Enterprise deployment">
        If you are using an Enterprise deployment of Opik, you will need to set the following
        environment variables:

        ```bash wordWrap
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://<comet-deployment-url>/opik/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default'
        ```

        <Tip>
            To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the
            `projectName` parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
            environment variable:

            ```bash wordWrap
            export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default,projectName=<your-project-name>'
            ```

            You can also update the `Comet-Workspace` parameter to a different
            value if you would like to log the data to a different workspace.
        </Tip>
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Self-hosted instance" title="Self-hosted instance">

    If you are self-hosting Opik, you will need to set the following environment
    variables:

    ```bash
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5173/api/v1/private/otel
    ```

    <Tip>
        To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the `projectName`
        parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable:

        ```bash
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='projectName=<your-project-name>'
        ```

## Using Opik with Microsoft Agent Framework

The Microsoft Agent Framework has built-in OpenTelemetry instrumentation. Once you've configured the environment variables above, you can start creating agents and their traces will automatically be sent to Opik:

```python
import asyncio
import os

os.environ["ENABLE_OTEL"] = "True"
os.environ["ENABLE_SENSITIVE_DATA"] = "True"

from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor


def setup_telemetry():
    """Configure OpenTelemetry with HTTP exporter"""
    # Create a resource with service name and other metadata
    resource = Resource.create(
        {
            "service.name": "agent-framework-demo",
            "service.version": "1.0.0",
            "deployment.environment": "development",
        }
    )

    # Create TracerProvider with the resource
    provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)

    # Create BatchSpanProcessor with OTLPSpanExporter
    processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())
    provider.add_span_processor(processor)

    # Set the TracerProvider
    trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

    return tracer, provider


setup_telemetry()


async def main():
    # Initialize a chat agent with Azure OpenAI Responses
    agent = OpenAIChatClient(model_id="gpt-4.1").create_agent(
        name="HaikuBot",
        instructions="You are an upbeat assistant that writes beautifully.",
    )

    # This will automatically create a trace in Opik
    result = await agent.run("Write a haiku about Microsoft Agent Framework.")
    print(result)


asyncio.run(main())
```

The framework will automatically:
- Create traces for agent executions
- Log input prompts and outputs
- Track token usage and performance metrics
- Capture any errors or exceptions
