[Pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) is an open-source Python framework for building real-time voice and multimodal conversational AI agents. Developed by Daily, it enables fully programmable AI voice agents and supports multimodal interactions, positioning itself as a flexible solution for developers looking to build conversational AI systems.

This guide explains how to integrate Opik with Pipecat for observability and tracing of real-time voice agents, enabling you to monitor, debug, and optimize your Pipecat agents in the Opik dashboard.

## Account Setup

[Comet](https://www.comet.com/site?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=pipecat&utm_campaign=opik) provides a hosted version of the Opik platform, [simply create an account](https://www.comet.com/signup?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=pipecat&utm_campaign=opik) and grab your API Key.

> You can also run the Opik platform locally, see the [installation guide](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/self-host/overview/?from=llm&utm_source=opik&utm_medium=colab&utm_content=pipecat&utm_campaign=opik) for more information.

## Getting started

To use the Pipecat integration with Opik, you will need to have Pipecat and the required OpenTelemetry packages installed:

```bash
pip install pipecat-ai[daily,webrtc,silero,cartesia,deepgram,openai,tracing] opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http websockets
```

<Tabs>
    <Tab value="Opik Cloud" title="Opik Cloud">
        ```bash wordWrap
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://www.comet.com/opik/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default'
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Enterprise deployment" title="Enterprise deployment">
        ```bash wordWrap
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://<comet-deployment-url>/opik/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default'
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Self-hosted instance" title="Self-hosted instance">
        ```bash
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5173/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='projectName=<your-project-name>'
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Opik with Pipecat

For the basic example, you'll need an OpenAI API key. You can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

Or set it programmatically:

```python
import os
import getpass

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your OpenAI API key: ")
```

Enable tracing in your Pipecat application by setting up OpenTelemetry instrumentation and configuring your pipeline task. For complete details on Pipecat's OpenTelemetry implementation, see the [official Pipecat OpenTelemetry documentation](https://docs.pipecat.ai/server/utilities/opentelemetry):

```python
# Initialize OpenTelemetry with the http exporter
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from pipecat.utils.tracing.setup import setup_tracing

# Configured automatically from .env
exporter = OTLPSpanExporter()

setup_tracing(
    service_name="pipecat-demo",
    exporter=exporter,
)

# Enable tracing in your PipelineTask
task = PipelineTask(
    pipeline,
    params=PipelineParams(
        allow_interruptions=True,
        enable_metrics=True,  # Required for some service metrics
    ),
    enable_tracing=True,  # Enables both turn and conversation tracing
    conversation_id="customer-123",  # Optional - will auto-generate if not provided
)
```

## Trace Structure

Pipecat organizes traces hierarchically following the natural structure of conversations, as documented in their [OpenTelemetry guide](https://docs.pipecat.ai/server/utilities/opentelemetry):

```
Conversation (conversation_id)
├── turn
│   ├── stt (Speech-to-Text)
│   ├── llm (Language Model)
│   └── tts (Text-to-Speech)
└── turn
    ├── stt
    ├── llm
    └── tts
```

This structure allows you to track the complete lifecycle of conversations and measure latency for individual turns and services.

## Understanding the Traces

Based on Pipecat's [OpenTelemetry implementation](https://docs.pipecat.ai/server/utilities/opentelemetry), the traces include:

- **Conversation Spans**: Top-level spans with conversation ID and type
- **Turn Spans**: Individual conversation turns with turn number, duration, and interruption status
- **Service Spans**: Detailed service operations with rich attributes:
  - **LLM Services**: Model, input/output tokens, response text, tool configurations, TTFB metrics
  - **TTS Services**: Voice ID, character count, synthesized text, TTFB metrics  
  - **STT Services**: Transcribed text, language detection, voice activity detection
- **Performance Metrics**: Time to first byte (TTFB) and processing durations for each service

## Results viewing

Once your Pipecat applications are traced with Opik, you can view the OpenTelemetry traces in the Opik UI. You will see:

- Hierarchical conversation and turn structure as sent by Pipecat
- Service-level spans with the attributes Pipecat includes (LLM tokens, TTS character counts, STT transcripts)
- Performance metrics like processing durations and time-to-first-byte where provided by Pipecat
- Standard OpenTelemetry trace visualization and search capabilities

### Getting Help

- Check the [Pipecat OpenTelemetry Documentation](https://docs.pipecat.ai/server/utilities/opentelemetry) for tracing setup and configuration
- Review the [OpenTelemetry Python Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/python/) for general OTEL setup
- Visit the [Pipecat GitHub repository](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) for framework-specific issues
- Check Opik documentation for trace viewing and OpenTelemetry endpoint configuration
