[LangChainJS](https://js.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) is the Javascript package for LangChain which allows you to develop
applications powered by Large Language Models.

Opik provides an integration that allows you to log all your chain executions to
the Opik dashboard, making it easier to debug your chains and monitor your
applicaation in production.

<Note>
  If you are using the Python LangChain package, refer to [this integration guide](/tracing/integrations/langchain)
</Note>

## Getting Started

To use Opik with LangChainJS, make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
npm install langchain @langchain/core opik-langchain
```

In addition you will need to set the following environment variables to make
sure the data is logged to Opik if you are using the Cloud platform:

```bash
export OPIK_URL_OVERRIDE="https://www.comet.com/opik/api"
export OPIK_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export OPIK_WORKSPACE_NAME=<your-workspace-name>
```

## Logging a chain

In order to log a chain, you will need to create the Opik callback:

```js
import { OpikCallbackHandler } from "opik-langchain";

const opikCallback = new OpikCallbackHandler();
```

You can then use this callback in your LangChain chain:

```js {3,15,19}
import { OpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { OpikCallbackHandler } from "opik/langchain";

// This is just a demo that doesn't require API key
const model = new OpenAI({
  temperature: 0.9,
});

const prompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate("What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?");

const chain = prompt.pipe(model);
const opikHandler = new OpikCallbackHandler();

const result = await chain.invoke({ product: "colorful socks" }, { callbacks: [opikHandler] });
```

## Settings tags and metadata

You can also customize the `OpikCallbackHandler` to include additional metadata,
tags. For example:

```js {pytest_codeblocks_skip=true}
const opikHandler = new OpikCallbackHandler({
  tags: ["langchain"],
  metadata: { "use-case": "documentation-example" },
});
```

## Logging to a specific project

You can also log to a specific project by setting the `project` parameter:

```js {pytest_codeblocks_skip=true}
const opikHandler = new OpikCallbackHandler({
  projectName: "my-project",
});
```

Or alternatively, you can use the environment variable:

```bash
export OPIK_PROJECT_NAME="my-project"
```
