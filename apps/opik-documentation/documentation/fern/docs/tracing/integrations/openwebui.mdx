[OpenWebUI](https://openwebui.com/) is a self-hosted WebUI that operates offline and supports various LLM runners, including Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs. OpenWebUI is open source and can easily be deployed on your own infrastructure.

Opik offers open source observability for OpenWebUI. By enabling the Opik integration through Pipelines, you can trace your application data with Opik to develop, monitor, and improve the use of OpenWebUI, including:

* Application traces
* Usage patterns
* LLM interaction analysis

## How to integrate Opik with OpenWebUI

Pipelines in OpenWebUI is a UI-agnostic framework for OpenAI API plugins. It enables the injection of plugins that intercept, process, and forward user prompts to the final LLM, allowing for enhanced control and customization of prompt handling.

To trace your application data with Opik, you can use the Opik filter pipeline, which enables real-time monitoring and analysis of message interactions.

## Setup OpenWebUI

Make sure to have OpenWebUI running. To do so, have a look at the [OpenWebUI documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/).

## Set Up Pipelines

Launch Pipelines by using Docker. Use the following command to start Pipelines:

```bash
docker run -p 9099:9099 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v pipelines:/app/pipelines --name pipelines --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/pipelines:main
```

## Connecting OpenWebUI with Pipelines

In the **Admin Panel > Settings**, create and save a new connection of type OpenAI API with the following details:

* **URL:** `http://localhost:9099/` (this is where the previously launched Docker container is running)
* **Password:** `0p3n-w3bu!` (standard password)

<Note>
If your Open WebUI is running in a Docker container, replace `localhost` with `host.docker.internal` in the API URL.
</Note>

## Adding the Opik Filter Pipeline

Next, navigate to **Admin Panel > Settings > Pipelines** and add the Opik Filter Pipeline. When configuring the pipeline connection, use the same URL you configured in the previous step (either `http://localhost:9099` or `http://host.docker.internal:9099` if OpenWebUI is in Docker). Install the Opik Filter Pipeline by using the _Install from GitHub URL_ option with the following URL:

```
https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines/blob/main/examples/filters/opik_filter_pipeline.py
```

Now, add your Opik API keys below. If you haven't signed up to Opik yet, you can get your API keys by creating an account [here](https://www.comet.com/signup?from=opik).

### Configuration Options

After installing the pipeline, you can configure the following valves in the **Pipelines Valves** section:

* **Api Key**: Your Opik API key (required)
* **Workspace**: Your Opik workspace name (optional, defaults to "default")
* **Project Name**: The project name for organizing traces (optional)
* **Host**: The URL of your Opik instance (defaults to `https://www.comet.com/opik/api` for Opik Cloud)
* **Debug**: Enable debug logging (optional)

### Capturing Token Usage

To capture token usage data for your models, navigate to the model settings in OpenWebUI and check the **"Usage"** box under _Capabilities_.

## See your traces in Opik

You can now interact with your OpenWebUI application and see the traces in Opik.
