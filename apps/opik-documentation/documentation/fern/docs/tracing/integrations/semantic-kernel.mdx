# Semantic Kernel Integration via OpenTelemetry

Semantic Kernel is Microsoft's AI orchestration framework designed to simplify the integration of AI services into applications. It provides a unified programming model for working with different AI models, memory systems, and plugins, making it easier to build intelligent applications.

Semantic Kernel's primary advantage is its seamless integration with Microsoft's AI ecosystem and its plugin architecture that allows developers to easily extend functionality with custom skills and connectors.


## Getting started

To use the Semantic Kernel integration with Opik, you will need to have Semantic Kernel and the required OpenTelemetry packages installed:

```bash
pip install semantic-kernel openinference-instrumentation-semantic-kernel opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
```

## Environment configuration

Configure your environment variables based on your Opik deployment:

<Tabs>
    <Tab value="Opik Cloud" title="Opik Cloud">
        If you are using Opik Cloud, you will need to set the following
        environment variables:
            
        ```bash wordWrap
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://www.comet.com/opik/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default'
        ```

        <Tip>
            To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the
            `projectName` parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
            environment variable:

            ```bash wordWrap
            export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default,projectName=<your-project-name>'
            ```

            You can also update the `Comet-Workspace` parameter to a different
            value if you would like to log the data to a different workspace.
        </Tip>
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Enterprise deployment" title="Enterprise deployment">
        If you are using an Enterprise deployment of Opik, you will need to set the following
        environment variables:

        ```bash wordWrap
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://<comet-deployment-url>/opik/api/v1/private/otel
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default'
        ```

        <Tip>
            To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the
            `projectName` parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
            environment variable:

            ```bash wordWrap
            export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='Authorization=<your-api-key>,Comet-Workspace=default,projectName=<your-project-name>'
            ```

            You can also update the `Comet-Workspace` parameter to a different
            value if you would like to log the data to a different workspace.
        </Tip>
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Self-hosted instance" title="Self-hosted instance">

    If you are self-hosting Opik, you will need to set the following environment
    variables:

    ```bash
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5173/api/v1/private/otel
    ```

    <Tip>
        To log the traces to a specific project, you can add the `projectName`
        parameter to the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable:

        ```bash
        export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='projectName=<your-project-name>'
        ```

    </Tip>
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Using Opik with Semantic Kernel

Set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Semantic Kernel:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from openinference.instrumentation.semantic_kernel import SemanticKernelInstrumentor

# Configure the OTLP exporter
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter()

# Set up the tracer provider
trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(
    BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
)

# Instrument Semantic Kernel
SemanticKernelInstrumentor().instrument()

# Your Semantic Kernel code will now automatically send traces to Opik
import semantic_kernel as sk

kernel = sk.Kernel()
# ... kernel configuration
```
