title: Observability for Cursor with Opik
description: Start here to integrate Opik into your Cursor-based genai application for end-to-end LLM observability, unit testing, and optimization.
---

The Cursor extension for Opik allows you to log all your Cursor conversations to Opik. Once they are available in Opik,
you can easily review them and share them with your team.

<Tip>
  You can link your Cursor conversations to PR's by just adding an Opik link, can be very useful when reviewing code
  changes !

## Installation

<Button intent="primary" href="cursor:extension/opik.opik">
  Install Cursor extension
</Button>

You can also install the Cursor extension manually by navigating to the `Extensions` tab at the top of the file sidebar and search for `Opik`.
From there, simply click on the `Install` button.

### Configuring the extension

In order to use the extension, you will need to configure your Opik API key. There are a few ways to do this:

    <Tab title="Extension settings">
    The most straightforward way to configure the extension is to use the extension settings.

    When you install the extension, you will see the following modal in the bottom left of your screen:
    <img src="/img/tracing/cursor_opik_extension_settings.png" />

    In this modal, click on `Open Settings` and paste your Opik API key in the `Opik: Opik API Key` field.
    You can find your API key in the [Opik dashboard](https://www.comet.com/api/my/settings).

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Configuration file">
    You can also use a configuration file in your home directory (`~/.opik.config`). While you can create the file manually (reference documentation can be
    found [here](/tracing/sdk_configuration)), assuming you have the Opik Python SDK installed we recommend using the `opik configure` command to create
    the file for you.
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

Once the extension is installed, all your new Cursor conversations will be logged to Opik.

## MCP Server Integration

The extension automatically registers an Opik MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with Cursor when you have an API key configured. This enables Cursor's AI to access your Opik project data during conversations, providing enhanced context about your traces and experiments.

The MCP server integration is enabled by default and requires no additional configuration. For more details about the MCP server, see the [opik-mcp package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opik-mcp).

## Viewing your conversations

Once the extension is installed and configured, all your conversations will be available in the `cursor` project in Opik. To
view the full conversation, you can navigate to the `threads` tab and click on any of the chats.

You can also review individual LLM responses by clicking on a trace in the `traces` tab. In the traces sidebar view, you can
see the full cursor event data in the metadata section.
