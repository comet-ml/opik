Claude's official telemetry setup is environment-variable based (no Python tracer bootstrap in their docs).

## Official telemetry setup (Claude docs)

```bash wordWrap
# 1) Enable telemetry
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1

# 2) Choose exporters
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=otlp
export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp

# 3) OTLP target
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317

# 4) Optional auth header
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer your-token"

# 5) Run Claude
claude
```

## Important compatibility note

Claude telemetry docs currently describe **metrics and events/logs** signals. Opik's tracing UI is built around **trace spans**. That means this integration is configuration-compatible at OTLP transport level, but signal compatibility depends on what your backend path ingests.

If your goal is Opik trace analysis specifically, verify that the emitted signal path includes traces from your application stack (not only metrics/events).
