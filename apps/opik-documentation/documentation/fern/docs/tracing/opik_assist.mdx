<Warning>
**Beta Feature**: Opik Assist is currently in beta. Features and functionality may change as we continue to improve the experience.
</Warning>

Opik Assist is an AI-powered assistant that helps you quickly analyze, debug, and optimize your LLM application traces. Available in both Opik Cloud and self-hosted deployments, you can converse with the AI agent to:

- **Ask natural language questions** about your current trace and its spans
- **Identify performance issues** and bottlenecks automatically  
- **Get debugging recommendations** for failed or slow operations
- **Analyze patterns** within the selected trace
- **Understand cost implications** of your LLM calls

## Prerequisites

Before using Opik Assist, you need to configure an OpenAI provider in your workspace:

1. **Navigate to Workspace Settings** → **[AI Providers](/administration/workspace-settings/ai_providers)**
2. **Add an OpenAI provider** with your API key
3. Opik Assist uses OpenAI's GPT-4.1 model

## How to Use Opik Assist

1. **Navigate to your project** in Opik
2. **Open any trace** you want to analyze
3. **Click the "Debug with AI" button** (marked with a Beta badge)
4. **Use the chat interface** on the right panel to ask questions
5. **Type your message** in the chat input and get instant analysis and recommendations

## Self-Hosted Setup

Opik Assist is available for self-hosted deployments and can be enabled as follows:

### Docker Compose

To enable Opik Assist when using the `opik.sh` script:

```bash
./opik.sh --opik-ai
```

For manual Docker Compose configuration:

```bash
cd deployment/docker-compose
docker compose --profile opik-ai-backend \
  -e TOGGLE_OPIK_AI_ENABLED=true \
  -e OPIK_FRONTEND_FLAVOR=opik-ai-backend \
  up --detach
```

### Kubernetes (Helm)

Add the following to your Helm values file:

```yaml
component:
  ai-backend:
    enabled: true
```

Then upgrade your deployment:

```bash
helm upgrade opik opik/opik -f values.yaml
```

<Tip>
After enabling Opik Assist, remember to configure an OpenAI provider in Workspace Settings → AI Providers before using the feature.

## Data Privacy & Security

Your trace data security and privacy are our top priorities. Here's exactly how your data is handled:

### Privacy Guarantees (Opik Cloud)
- **No Training**: Your trace data is **never used** to train AI models
- **Quality Assurance Only**: Comet retains logs of prompts and responses solely for internal quality assurance and debugging
- **No Third-Party Training**: These logs are not used for training third-party models

### What Data is Shared with OpenAI
To provide intelligent analysis, Opik Assist sends the following to OpenAI:
- **Trace and span metadata**: Names, timestamps, latency information
- **Input/output content**: The actual prompts, responses, and tool outputs from your trace
- **Performance metrics**: Token counts, costs, and timing data
- **Error information**: Any error messages or status codes in the trace

### What Data is NOT Shared
- **Opik system identifiers**: No API keys, or authentication tokens from Opik
- **Account information**: No workspace or project identifying information
- **Historical data**: Only the current trace being analyzed

<Warning>
**Important**: Your trace data (inputs/outputs) may contain personal or sensitive information that you've included in prompts or responses. This content will be sent to OpenAI as part of the trace analysis.
</Warning>

## Current Limitations (Beta)

As a beta feature, Opik Assist currently has some limitations:

- **Single Trace Analysis**: Can only analyze one trace at a time, no cross-trace comparisons or aggregations
- **Rate Limits**: Usage may be subject to rate limiting during peak times (Opik Cloud only)

## Feedback & Support

Since this is a beta feature, we'd love to hear your feedback:
