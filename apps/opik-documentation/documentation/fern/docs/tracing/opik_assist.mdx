<Warning>
**Beta Feature**: Opik Assist is currently in beta and available exclusively on Opik Cloud (www.comet.com). Features and functionality may change as we continue to improve the experience.
</Warning>

Opik Assist is an AI-powered assistant that helps you quickly analyze, debug, and optimize your LLM application traces. By conversing with the AI agent, you can:

- **Ask natural language questions** about your current trace and its spans
- **Identify performance issues** and bottlenecks automatically  
- **Get debugging recommendations** for failed or slow operations
- **Analyze patterns** within the selected trace
- **Understand cost implications** of your LLM calls

## How to Use Opik Assist

1. **Navigate to your project** in Opik Cloud
2. **Open any trace** you want to analyze
3. **Click the "Debug with AI" button** (marked with a Beta badge)
4. **Use the chat interface** on the right panel to ask questions
5. **Type your message** in the chat input and get instant analysis and recommendations

## Data Privacy & Security

Your trace data security and privacy are our top priorities. Here's exactly how your data is handled:

### Privacy Guarantees
- **No Training**: Your trace data is **never used** to train AI models
- **Quality Assurance Only**: Comet retains logs of prompts and responses solely for internal quality assurance and debugging
- **No Third-Party Training**: These logs are not used for training third-party models

### What Data is Shared with OpenAI
To provide intelligent analysis, Opik Assist sends the following to OpenAI's AI models:
- **Trace and span metadata**: Names, timestamps, latency information
- **Input/output content**: The actual prompts, responses, and tool outputs from your trace
- **Performance metrics**: Token counts, costs, and timing data
- **Error information**: Any error messages or status codes in the trace

### What Data is NOT Shared
- **Opik system identifiers**: No API keys, or authentication tokens from Opik
- **Account information**: No workspace or project identifying information
- **Historical data**: Only the current trace being analyzed

<Warning>
**Important**: While Opik doesn't send system identifiers, your trace data (inputs/outputs) may contain personal or sensitive information that you've included in prompts or responses. This content will be sent to OpenAI as part of the trace analysis.
</Warning>

## Current Limitations (Beta)

As a beta feature, Opik Assist currently has some limitations:

- **Cloud Only**: Available exclusively on Opik Cloud, not in self-hosted deployments
- **Single Trace Analysis**: Can only analyze one trace at a time, no cross-trace comparisons or aggregations
- **Rate Limits**: Usage may be subject to rate limiting during peak times

## Feedback & Support

Since this is a beta feature, we'd love to hear your feedback:

- Report issues via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik/issues)
- Join our [Slack community](http://chat.comet.com/) for real-time support
