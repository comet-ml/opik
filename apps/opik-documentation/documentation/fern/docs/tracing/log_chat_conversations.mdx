## Logging conversations

You can log chat conversations by specifying the `thread_id` parameter when using either the low level SDK or
Python decorators:

    <Tab title="Python decorators" value="Python decorators">
    ```python
    import opik
    from opik import opik_context

    @opik.track
    def chat_message(input, thread_id):
        opik_context.update_current_trace(
            thread_id=thread_id
        )
        return "Opik is an Open Source GenAI platform"

    thread_id = "f174a"
    chat_message("What is Opik ?", thread_id)
    chat_message("Repeat the previous message", thread_id)
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Low level SDK" value="Low level SDK">
    ```python
    import opik

    opik_client = opik.Opik()

    thread_id = "55d84"

    # Log a first message
    trace = opik_client.trace(
        name="chat_conversation",
        input="What is Opik?",
        output="Opik is an Open Source GenAI platform",
        thread_id=thread_id
    )

    # Log a second message
    trace = opik_client.trace(
        name="chat_conversation",
        input="Can you track chat conversations in Opik",
        output="Yes, of course !",
        thread_id=thread_id
    )
    ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>
  The input to each trace will be displayed as the user message while the output will be displayed as the AI assistant
  response.
</Note>

## Reviewing conversations

Conversations can be viewed at a project level in the `threads` tab. All conversations are tracked and by clicking on the thread ID you will be able to
view the full conversation.

The thread view supports markdown making it easier for you to review the content that was returned to the user. If you would like to dig in deeper, you
can click on the `View trace` button to deepdive into how the AI assistant response was generated.

By clicking on the thumbs up or thumbs down icons, you can quickly rate the AI assistant response. This feedback score will be logged and associated to
the relevant trace. By switching to the trace view, you can review the full trace as well as add additional feedback scores through the annotation
functionality.
