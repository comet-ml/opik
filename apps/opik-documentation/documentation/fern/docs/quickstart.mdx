## Logging your first LLM calls

Opik makes it easy to integrate with your existing LLM application, here are some of our most
popular integrations:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OpenAI (Python)" value="openai-python-sdk">
    If you are using the OpenAI Python SDK, you can integrate by:

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Install the Opik Python SDK:

        ```bash
        pip install opik
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Configure the Opik Python SDK, this will prompt you for your API key if you are using Opik
        Cloud or your Opik server address if you are self-hosting:

        ```bash
        opik configure
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Wrap your OpenAI client with the `track_openai` function:

        ```python
        from opik.integrations.openai import track_openai
        from openai import OpenAI

        # Wrap your OpenAI client
        openai_client = OpenAI()
        openai_client = track_openai(openai_client)
        ```

        All OpenAI calls made using the `openai_client` will now be logged to Opik.

      </Step>
    </Steps>

        # export OPIK_URL_OVERRIDE="http://localhost:5173/api" # Self-hosting
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Wrap your OpenAI client with the `trackOpenAI` function:

        ```typescript
        import OpenAI from "openai";
        import { trackOpenAI } from "opik-openai";

        // Initialize the original OpenAI client
        const openai = new OpenAI({
          apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
        });

        // Wrap the client with Opik tracking
        const trackedOpenAI = trackOpenAI(openai);

        // Use the tracked client just like the original
        const completion = await trackedOpenAI.chat.completions.create({
          model: "gpt-4",
          messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello, how can you help me today?" }],
        });
        console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);

        // Ensure all traces are sent before your app terminates
        await trackedOpenAI.flush();
        ```

        All OpenAI calls made using the `trackedOpenAI` will now be logged to Opik.

  <Tab title="AI Wizard" value="ai-installation">
    The AI integration wizard will get you setup with Opik in just a few minutes with just one
    prompt !

    <Steps>
      <Step title="1. Install the Opik extension for Cursor">
      We will first install the Opik extension for Cursor that will both setup the Opik MCP server
      for you and also log your Cursor conversations to Opik. You can learn more about the extension
      [here](/tracing/integrations/cursor):

      <Button intent="primary" href="cursor:extension/opik.opik">Install Cursor extension</Button>

      </Step>
      <Step title="2. Run the following prompt in the Cursor chat">
        Once it is installed, you can run the following prompt in the Cursor chat (make sure to run
        in agent mode so tools can be called):

        ```text
        Integrate Opik with my project.
        ```

        Once the integration is complete, you will need to setup your Opik Cloud API key or point
        to your self-hosted Opik server. You can learn more about the configuration
        [here](/tracing/sdk_configuration).

      </Step>
      <Step title="3. (Optional) Manually install the Opik MCP server">
            If you are using another AI assistant, first install the Opik MCP server following the
      instructions in the [MCP Server Integration](/prompt_engineering/mcp_server) documentation and
      then run the prompt above.

</Tabs>

<Tip>
Opik has over 30 integrations with the most popular frameworks and libraries and we couldn't list
them all here, you can find [a full list of integrations here](/tracing/integrations/overview).

You can also instrument your code using our [Python SDK](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/python-sdk-reference/),
[Typescript SDK](/reference/typescript-sdk/overview) or [Rest API](/reference/rest-api/overview).

Opik also has a playground which is perfect if you want to experiment with prompts and models but
don't want to write any code, you can find more information about the playground
[here](/prompt_engineering/playground).

</Tip>

## Next steps

Now that you have logged your first LLM calls and chains to Opik, why not check out:

1. [In depth guide on logging LLM calls](/tracing/log_traces): Learn how to customize the data that is logged to Opik and how to log conversations.
2. [Opik's evaluation metrics](/evaluation/metrics/overview): Opik provides a suite of evaluation metrics (Hallucination, Answer Relevance, Context Recall, etc.) that you can use to score your LLM responses.
3. [Opik Experiments](/evaluation/concepts): Opik allows you to automated the evaluation process of your LLM application so that you no longer need to manually review every LLM response.

## How can I diagnose issues with Opik?

If you are experiencing any problems using Opik, such as receiving 400 or 500 errors from the backend, or being unable to connect at all, we recommend running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
opik healthcheck
```

This command will analyze your configuration and backend connectivity, providing useful insights into potential issues.
