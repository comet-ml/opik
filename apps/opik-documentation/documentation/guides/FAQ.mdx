## General

### Can I use Opik to monitor my LLM application in production?

Yes, Opik has been designed from the ground up to be used to monitor production applications. If you are self-hosting the
Opik platform, we recommend using the [Kuberneters deployment](/self-host/overview.md) option to ensure that Opik can scale as needed.

## Opik Cloud

### Are there are rate limits on Opik Cloud?

Yes, in order to ensure all users have a good experience we have implemented rate limits. Each user is limited to `10,000` events per minute, an event is a trace, span, feedback score, dataset item, experiment item, etc. If you need to increase this limit please reach out to us on [Slack](https://chat.comet.com).
