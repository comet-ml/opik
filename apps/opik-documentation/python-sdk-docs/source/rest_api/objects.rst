REST API Objects
================

This page documents all the public data types and response models used by the REST API methods.
These objects represent the data structures returned by REST API calls and used as parameters.

The types are automatically generated from the REST API definition and include classes for resources,
page objects for pagination, filter objects for queries, and various utility types.

.. note::
   These are the raw REST API data types. For the main SDK objects like ``Dataset``, ``Experiment``, etc., 
   see the main :doc:`../Opik` documentation and the Objects section in the main documentation.
