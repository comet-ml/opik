# ESNODE-Code of Conduct

Our community is built on professionalism, respect, and collaboration. We expect all contributors, users, and maintainers to:

- Be respectful and considerate. Focus on technical issues; avoid personal attacks, harassment, or discriminatory language.
- Assume good intent and seek constructive dialogue. Clarify disagreements with evidence and empathy.
- Keep discussions inclusive. Ensure newcomers feel welcome; avoid gatekeeping.
- Protect privacy and security. Do not post secrets, sensitive logs, or private data.
- Follow project policies. Adhere to `LICENSE`, `docs/CLA.md`, `docs/TRADEMARK_POLICY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Report unacceptable behavior. Contact conduct@estimatedstocks.com or security@estimatedstocks.com for confidential escalation.

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, hate speech, threats, doxxing, or any conduct that disrupts the community. Maintainers may take action (warnings, content removal, bans) as needed to protect participants and the project.
