- Code must follow style conventions and be well-documented
- use design patterns where appropriate
- Avoid code duplication; use utility classes or methods
- Ensure code is modular and reusable
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods short and focused on a single task
- Use comments to explain complex logic or decisions
- Use consistent naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables
- Avoid hardcoding values; use constants or configuration files
- changes must pass spotless checks
- prefer using Map.of(), List.of(), Set.of() for creating immutable collections
