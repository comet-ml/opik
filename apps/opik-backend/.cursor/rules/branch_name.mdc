- PR description must include these sections:
  - **Details**: what the change does, why it was made, and any design decisions
  - **Resolves**: URL of the GitHub issue this PR fixes (e.g. `https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123`), or `NA`
  - **Testing**: scenarios covered by tests and steps to reproduce
  - **Documentation**: list of docs updated or summary of new configuration introduced
- Git Commits must follow this format: {JIRA-TICKET}: {JIRA-TICKET}
