# ai-labels runbook

ai-labels labels every ended trace in opted-in workspaces with AI-generated labels, computed by opik-inference. It
runs only where `AI_LABELS_ENABLED=true` (Comet-hosted deployments); it is off everywhere else, including OSS.

## Turning it on for a deployment

| Env var | Value |
|---|---|
| `AI_LABELS_ENABLED` | `true` |
| `AI_LABELS_INFERENCE_URL` | the opik-inference cell, e.g. `https://opik-inference.comet.com` |
| `AI_LABELS_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL` | the deployment's opik-inference credential, from a secret (`component.backend.secretRefs`) |

- The backend refuses to start with ai-labels on unless `ANALYTICS_DB_DATA_MODEL_TRACE_COLUMNS_NON_NULLABLE=true`
  (the cut-over `traces` table). The `spans` cutover doesn't need to be done.
- opik-inference: the deployment needs its own `deployments` entry and credential in `config/inference.yaml`, with
  `allowed_orgs: "*"`. Opik sends workspace ids as `org_id`, so a real-org allow-list answers 403 `org_not_allowed`.
- Every other `aiLabels` setting is in `apps/opik-backend/config.yml` and overridable as `AI_LABELS_*`.

## Opting workspaces in and out

Opt-in is the `ai_label_workspaces` table in the state database (MySQL). There is no API.

Before enabling a workspace, check how much it will backfill: its traces in the horizon (7 days by default). Traces
created before a task's `applies_from` are never labeled.

```sql
-- ClickHouse
SELECT count()
FROM traces
WHERE workspace_id = '<workspace_id>'
  AND created_at >= now64(6) - INTERVAL 7 DAY;
```

The sweep hands each workspace at most `AI_LABELS_PER_WORKSPACE_CANDIDATES` (10,000) traces a minute, and the global
budget (`AI_LABELS_BUDGET_ENGINE_CALLS`) and the pool's throughput usually bind first. Expect a backfill of at least
count ÷ 10,000 minutes.

```sql
-- MySQL: enable (or re-enable) a workspace
INSERT INTO ai_label_workspaces (workspace_id, enabled, added_by)
VALUES ('<workspace_id>', TRUE, '<your name>')
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE enabled = TRUE, added_by = '<your name>';

-- MySQL: disable a workspace. Immediate: the next sweep drops it. Jobs in flight still load, and labels stay.
UPDATE ai_label_workspaces SET enabled = FALSE WHERE workspace_id = '<workspace_id>';

-- MySQL: list the enabled workspaces
SELECT workspace_id, added_at, added_by FROM ai_label_workspaces WHERE enabled = TRUE ORDER BY added_at;
```

## Reading summaries

There is no UI yet. Take each trace's latest label (by write time):

```sql
-- ClickHouse
SELECT trace_id, task_version, JSONExtractString(output, 'summary') AS summary
FROM ai_labels
WHERE workspace_id = '<workspace_id>'
  AND project_id = '<project_id>'
  AND task = 'trace_summary'
  AND key = 'output'
ORDER BY workspace_id, project_id, task, trace_id, key, updated_at DESC
LIMIT 1 BY workspace_id, project_id, task, trace_id, key;
```

## What to watch

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ai_labels.unsettled_past_slo` | Unsettled (trace, task) pairs past the SLO, per workspace. The headline. |
| `ai_labels.budget.in_flight` / `.limit` | Engine calls in flight against the budget. |
| `ai_labels.items.failed` by `error_code` | `render_over_budget`, `render_error`, `job_lost`, `missing_result`, `missing_answer`, or the service's code. |
| `ai_labels.submit.rejected` | A submit rejected with 400: a renderer or task bug. |
| `ai_labels.sweep.guard_trips` | A sweep query hit a ClickHouse guard: raise `AI_LABELS_SWEEP_BUCKETS`. |
| `ai_labels.render.compaction_level`, `.bytes` | How far traces had to be compacted to fit. |
