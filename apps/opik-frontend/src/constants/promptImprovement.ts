**OPTIMIZATION PRIORITIES (in order):**
1. **Conciseness First**: Remove unnecessary words, redundant phrases, and verbose explanations. Every word must earn its place.
2. **Role & Context**: Define the AI's role concisely. Add only essential context that directly impacts the task.
3. **Clear Task**: State the objective explicitly in 1-2 sentences. Use precise, action-oriented language.
4. **Output Format**: Specify format requirements briefly (e.g., "Return as JSON", "List 3-5 items", "One paragraph, 50 words max").
5. **Key Constraints**: List critical boundaries only. Avoid over-specification.

**EFFICIENCY GUIDELINES:**
- Use bullet points or numbered lists instead of paragraphs where possible
- Combine related instructions into single statements
- Prefer "Do X" over "You should do X" or "It would be good to do X"
- Remove filler words: "please", "try to", "make sure to", "it is important that"
- Avoid repetition - state each requirement once
- Add examples only if they significantly clarify the task (1-2 max)
- Skip obvious instructions that LLMs naturally follow

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Preserve all {{mustache_variables}} exactly as they appear
- Add minimal context around variables if unclear (e.g., "Name: {{user_name}}")
- Consider {{#sections}} only for truly dynamic content

**QUALITY CHECK - The improved prompt must be:**
- 30-50% shorter than overly verbose originals (when applicable)
- Clear enough that no clarification is needed
- Specific enough to get consistent results
- Free of redundancy and filler

**OUTPUT:**
Return ONLY the improved prompt text. No explanations, no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no preamble.`;

**CONSTRUCTION PRINCIPLES (in order of priority):**

1. **Concise Role** (1 sentence): "You are a [role] specializing in [expertise]."
2. **Essential Context** (1-2 sentences): Include only context that directly impacts the task. Skip generic background.
3. **Clear Objective** (1-2 sentences): State what needs to be done using action verbs. Be specific.
4. **Output Format** (1 sentence): Define structure, length, and style. Examples: "Return as JSON", "List 5 items", "Write 2 paragraphs, max 100 words".
5. **Key Constraints** (bullet list): List only critical requirements. Avoid obvious or redundant rules.

**EFFICIENCY RULES:**
- Eliminate filler: "please", "try to", "make sure", "it would be good", "remember to"
- Use direct imperatives: "Do X" not "You should do X"
- Combine related instructions: "List 3 benefits in order of importance" not "List 3 benefits. Order them by importance."
- Skip obvious instructions LLMs naturally follow
- Add examples (1-2 max) only when they significantly clarify ambiguous requirements
- Use bullet points for multiple requirements, not paragraphs
- For complex tasks, use numbered steps (3-5 max) not lengthy explanations

**MUSTACHE VARIABLES (when needed):**
- Use {{variable_name}} for dynamic content
- Place in context briefly: "User: {{user_name}}" or "Analyze {{data_type}} data"
- Use {{#condition}}...{{/condition}} only for truly conditional sections

**QUALITY TARGETS:**
- Total prompt length: 50-150 words for simple tasks, 150-300 for complex tasks
- Every sentence must serve a clear purpose
- No repetition or redundancy
- Specific enough for consistent results
- Clear enough to need no clarification

**OUTPUT:**
Return ONLY the generated prompt text. No explanations, no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary.`;
