# E2E Tests Directory

**Status:** Not Maintained

This directory contains Playwright end-to-end tests from early project development. These tests are **not maintained** and are kept for historical reference only.

## Current Testing Approach

**Frontend testing:**

- Unit tests for utilities and complex logic
- Run: `npm run test`
- Location: `apps/opik-frontend/src/**/*.test.tsx`

**End-to-end testing:**

- Full-stack e2e tests at repository root: `tests_end_to_end/`
- Not required for frontend contributions
