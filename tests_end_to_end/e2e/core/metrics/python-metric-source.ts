/**
 * Python source for user-defined-metric rules used by online-evaluation specs.
 *
 * These are plain string builders, not fixtures: they own no state and need no
 * per-test setup or teardown, so there is nothing for a fixture's `use()` to
 * bracket. They live here rather than in one spec because more than one spec
 * needs the same metric.
 *
 * Two constraints apply to every snippet, and both are easy to break by
 * accident:
 *
 *   - **No extra `BaseMetric` imports.** The python evaluator's
 *     `get_metric_class` walks module classes alphabetically and takes the first
 *     `BaseMetric` subclass, so importing one of opik's own heuristics (Equals,
 *     Moderation, …) can shadow the class defined here.
 *   - **The `ScoreResult` name is what lands on the trace**, not the rule name —
 *     the engine uses the score-result name verbatim. Hence `scoreName` is
 *     interpolated into the source rather than left to the caller.
 */

/**
 * A metric that returns a constant 1.0 for whatever it is handed.
 *
 * For specs asking *whether* an evaluation happened rather than what it
 * concluded: a 0.0 would then mean "ran on unexpected input", which is a
 * different failure from "was never evaluated".
 *
 * `scoreArgs` declares `score()`'s parameters. The default (`output`) suits a
 * rule mapping one whole section. Pass explicit names when the rule maps
 * sub-paths: an unresolvable sub-path is dropped from the argument map by
 * `OnlineScoringEngine.toReplacements`, so every parameter must have a default
 * or the call raises a TypeError that reads exactly like the bug under test.

 * dispatches `metric.score(data)` — one POSITIONAL argument carrying the whole
 * conversation — while the trace-scoped path spreads the argument map as
 * keywords (`metric.score(**data)`). A `score()` whose first parameter is named
 * `output` would still be called successfully here, which is precisely why this
 * is worth stating: the parameter name is inert on this path, so the thread
 * metric declares the name the backend documents (`CONTEXT_ARG_NAME`) instead
 * of borrowing a trace-shaped one that would read as though it mattered.
 *
 * Constant rather than derived from the conversation: the specs using this ask
 * whether every thread in a fan-out was evaluated, not what the metric
 * concluded — a value that varied with the input would make "scored the wrong
 * thread" and "scored correctly" produce the same number.
