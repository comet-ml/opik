Your task is to accurately answer questions about historical sports and media figures. Use the `Predict(question) -> answer` module to provide precise responses to the questions posed by the contestants. Ensure your answers are based on the knowledge you have about notable individuals and their connections across different roles and timelines. For example, if asked about the future head coach of the University of Pittsburgh football team who was replaced by Dick Jauron as head coach of the Chicago Bears, respond with the correct name confidently.\n",

       "['Developmental robotics | Developmental robotics (DevRob), sometimes called epigenetic robotics, is a scientific field which aims at studying the developmental mechanisms, architectures and constraints that allow lifelong and open-ended learning of new skills and new knowledge in embodied machines. As in human children, learning is expected to be cumulative and of progressively increasing complexity, and to result from self-exploration of the world in combination with social interaction. The typical methodological approach consists in starting from theories of human and animal development elaborated in fields such as developmental psychology, neuroscience, developmental and evolutionary biology, and linguistics, then to formalize and implement them in robots, sometimes exploring extensions or variants of them. The experimentation of those models in robots allows researchers to confront them with reality, and as a consequence developmental robotics also provides feedback and novel hypotheses on theories of human and animal development.',\n",
       " 'Evolutionary developmental robotics | Evolutionary developmental robotics (evo-devo-robo for short) refers to methodologies that systematically integrate evolutionary robotics, epigenetic robotics and morphogenetic robotics to study the evolution, physical and mental development and learning of natural intelligent systems in robotic systems. The field was formally suggested and fully discussed in a published paper and further discussed in a published dialogue.',\n",
       " 'Paladyn | Paladyn, \"Journal of Behavioral Robotics\", is a peer-reviewed scientific journal focussing on approaches to robotics that draw on analogies between autonomous robotics and embodied cognition, cognitive development, and the emergence of cognition and communication from social behavior. It is an electronic-only journal that publishes research on topics broadly related to neuronally and psychologically inspired robots and other behaving autonomous systems, including cognitive robotics, developmental robotics, evolutionary robotics, artificial embodied agents, self-organizing robot swarms, robot learning and adaptation, human–robot interaction, and neurally-inspired robot vision.

It takes a user-provided question and a trajectory of past actions (thoughts and tool usages) as input. The program operates in an iterative manner, where it generates a \"next thought\" to reason about the current situation, decides which tool to use (either to search Wikipedia for more information or to finish the task), and specifies the necessary arguments for that tool. After each tool call, it appends the resulting observations to the trajectory, enabling it to build context and inform future decisions. The process continues until the program gathers enough information to formulate an answer or decides that it has completed the task.\n",

      "[3] «Keeping Up with the Kardashians | Keeping Up with the Kardashians (often abbreviated KUWTK) is an American reality television series that airs on the E! cable network. The show focuses on the personal and professional lives of the Kardashian–Jenner blended family. Its premise originated with Ryan Seacrest, who also serves as an executive producer. The series debuted on October 14, 2007 and has subsequently become one of the longest-running reality television series in the country.

The agent first assesses the question and its trajectory, then decides whether to search for more information or finish the task. The program continues to iterate through this process until it has collected sufficient information to provide a complete answer, at which point it signals that the task is complete.\n",

It operates in a structured manner, where the agent (the program) receives a question and a trajectory of previous thoughts and tool calls. The agent's goal is to gather necessary information to formulate an answer to the question. It does this by interleaving reasoning (next_thought) with selecting the appropriate tool (next_tool_name) and the arguments for that tool (next_tool_args). The agent first assesses the question and its trajectory, then decides whether to search for more information or finish the task.

The program operates in a step-by-step manner, where it receives a question and a trajectory of previous thoughts and actions. It employs a reasoning process to determine the next steps required to gather necessary information. The agent can choose between two tools: one for searching Wikipedia to retrieve relevant information and another to mark the task as complete when enough information has been gathered. The program interleaves thoughts, tool selections, and arguments in its execution, allowing it to build a trajectory of observations that guide it towards formulating a final answer to the original question.\n",
