"""
Multimodal Driving Hazard Detection Example using Evolutionary Optimizer.

This example demonstrates:
1. Loading the DHPR dataset with images encoded as base64
2. Creating a multimodal prompt with structured content (text + images)
3. Using a vision-capable model (GPT-4o-mini) for hazard detection
4. Evaluating with a custom LLM-as-a-Judge metric
5. Optimizing the prompt with the Evolutionary Optimizer

The optimizer will evolve prompts to improve hazard detection accuracy
while preserving the image inputs throughout the evolutionary process.

Evaluate hazard detection with strict requirements:

1. **Accuracy (40%)**: Did it identify the EXACT hazard type?
   - Pedestrian vs vehicle vs obstacle specificity
   - Correct location (left/right/center/ahead)
   - Distance estimation if applicable

2. **Completeness (30%)**: All hazards mentioned?
   - Primary hazard (MUST catch this)
   - Secondary hazards (bonus points)
   - Environmental factors (weather, lighting, road conditions)

3. **Actionability (20%)**: Clear driver guidance?
   - Urgency level (immediate/moderate/low)
   - Recommended action (brake/slow/monitor/stop)
   - Timing (now vs approaching)

4. **Visual Understanding (10%)**: Correct image interpretation?
   - Scene context (highway, city, parking, intersection)
   - Traffic flow understanding
   - Spatial relationships between objects

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- Score 1.0: ALL critical hazards identified with precise locations and actionable details
- Score 0.7-0.9: Primary hazard caught with good details, minor omissions acceptable
- Score 0.5-0.6: Partial detection but missing key details or secondary hazards
- Score below 0.5: Missed critical hazards or major inaccuracies

Consider semantically equivalent descriptions as correct matches, but reward specificity.
