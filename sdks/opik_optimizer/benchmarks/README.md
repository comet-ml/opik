In order to assess the performance of Opik's Optimizatio algorithmns, we have a suite of benchmarks based on Open-Source projects.

## Running benchmarks

To run the benchmarks, you can use the following command:

```bash
uv venv

uv pip install -r requirements.txt && opik configure && uv run python run_benchmark.py
```
