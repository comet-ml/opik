## Test Naming and Structure
- Use convention: `test_WHAT__CASE_DESCRIPTION__EXPECTED_RESULT` or `test_WHAT__happyflow`
- Make tests easy to read and understand
- Before adding a new test, study existing similar tests nearby and make the new one consistent
- Always test public API only, never violate privacy

## Test Performance and Tools
- Make tests run as fast as possible
- `unittest.mock` or stub/fake objects can be used if needed
- `pytest` is used for testing
- End-to-end (e2e) tests should not test client-side logic branching, unless it leads to different endpoints used
- If a test is hard to make without reading protected attributes, create a read-only property
