## Import Organization
- Always import modules, not names (except from `typing` or similar commonly used modules)
- Keep the namespace clean
- Group imports: standard library, third-party, local imports

## Access Control
- Never violate access modifiers
- If method/attribute is used only inside its class - it should be protected
- If function/object is used only inside its module - it should be protected
- Classes may omit underscores in names if they are used only in their modules
- If unsure how something is used, search for examples in `opik/sdks/python/src` and `opik/sdks/python/tests`
