## Logger Configuration
- Use structured logging with proper logger hierarchies
- Configure logging with customizable formatters
- Create module-level loggers consistently with the variable name `LOGGER`

## Log Content and Levels
- Use appropriate log levels: DEBUG for detailed info, INFO and WARNING for user messages, ERROR for problems
- Implement log-once patterns for repeated messages
- Include relevant context without exposing sensitive information
- Include timing information for API calls and processing
