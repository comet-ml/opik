## Main API Class Usage
- `opik.Opik` is the main API class - use it to create other API objects (e.g. `create_experiment`)
- Provide higher level API through `opik.Opik` that wraps complicated REST calls (e.g. `search_spans`)
- Always look for similar APIs that already exist and make new ones consistent with them
- Maintain backward compatibility for public interfaces
