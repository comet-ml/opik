- Prioritize keeping the existing dependencies (stored setup.py) and not adding the new ones
- Keep dependency versions flexible with appropriate bounds
- Avoid adding heavy dependencies without strong justification
- Use conditional imports for optional dependencies (it's usually the case for integrations)
- Make sure the python versions specified in setup.py can execute new code
