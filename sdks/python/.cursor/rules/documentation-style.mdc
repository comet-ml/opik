## Code Documentation
- Use comprehensive type hints
- Use comprehensive docstrings for public APIs
- Follow established code formatting and linting standards

## Comments and Clarity
- Don't add over-verbose comments, write self-explanatory code
- Only add comments for non-trivial logic or when readers might ask "Why is it like that?"
- Write code that explains itself through good naming and structure
