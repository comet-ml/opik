## Test Structure and Location
- Always add tests for new features
- Follow the same path principles as existing tests
- e2e tests: split by features, located in `opik/sdks/python/tests/e2e`
- library integration tests: split by integrations, located in `opik/sdks/python/tests/library_integration`
- unit tests: replicate the opik package structure, located in `opik/sdks/python/tests/unit`

## Test Types and Organization
- Organize tests by type: unit tests, library integration tests, end-to-end and library-end-to-end tests
- Use testlib when possible (`opik/sdks/python/tests/testlib`)
- Integrations that log traces, spans or feedback scores via `opik.Opik` must be tested via library_integration tests using `fake_backend` fixture
