## Dependency Management
- Prioritize keeping existing dependencies (stored in setup.py) and avoid adding new ones
- Keep dependency versions flexible with appropriate bounds
- Avoid adding heavy dependencies without strong justification
- Use conditional imports for optional dependencies (usually the case for integrations)
- Make sure the python versions specified in setup.py can execute new code
