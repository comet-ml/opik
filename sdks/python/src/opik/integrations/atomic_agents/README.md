# Opik Ã— Atomic Agents Integration

This package will provide first-class support for tracing [Atomic Agents](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents) pipelines with Opik.

Planned features:

* Automatic tracing of `BaseAgent` executions
* Child-span creation for individual tools within an agent
* Context providers that inject Opik trace data into Atomic Agents prompts
* Input/output schema capture for richer observability

Implementation coming soon.
