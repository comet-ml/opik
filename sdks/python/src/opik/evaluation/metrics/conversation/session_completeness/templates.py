def extract_user_goals(conversation: Conversation) -> str:
    return f"""Based on the given list of message exchanges between a user and an LLM, generate a JSON object to extract all user goals in the conversation.

** Guidelines: **
- You should ONLY consider the overall intention, and not dwell too much on the specifics, as we are more concerned about the overall objective of the conversation.
- Make sure to only return in JSON format.
- The JSON should have 1 field: 'user_goals'.
- The 'user_goals' field should be a list of strings.

def evaluate_user_goal(conversation: Conversation, user_goal: str) -> str:
    return f"""Based on the given list of message exchanges between a user and an LLM, generate a JSON object to indicate whether given user goal was satisfied from the conversation messages.

** Guidelines: **
- You MUST USE look at all messages provided in the list of messages to make an informed judgement on satisfaction.
- Make sure to only return in JSON format.
- The JSON will have 2 fields: 'verdict' and 'reason'.
- The 'verdict' key should STRICTLY be either 'yes' or 'no', which states whether the user goal was satisfied or not.
- Provide a 'reason' ONLY if the answer is 'no'.
- You MUST TRY to quote some LLM responses if providing a reason.
- You DON'T have to provide a reason if the answer is 'yes'.
- ONLY provide a 'no' answer if the LLM responses are failed to satisfy the user intent.

    return f"""Below is a list of negative verdicts drawn from some messages in a conversation, which you have minimal knowledge of. It is a list of strings explaining why an LLM 'actual_output' is incomplete to satisfy the user `input` for a particular message.
Given the completeness score, which is a [0, 1] score indicating how incomplete the OVERALL `actual_output`s are to the user intentions found in the `input`s of a conversation (higher the better), CONCISELY summarize the reason of the negative verdicts to justify the score.

** Guidelines: **
- Make sure to only return in JSON format, with the 'reason' key providing the reason.
- Always quote information that are cited from messages in the negative verdicts in your final reason.
- You should NOT mention negative verdict in your reason, and make the reason sound convincing.
- You should mention LLM response instead of `actual_output`, and User instead of `input`.
- Always refer to user goals, but keep it minimal and phrase it in your own words. Explain which are met with supporting reason from the provided negative verdicts.
- Be confident in your reasoning, as if youâ€™re aware of the `actual_output`s from the messages in a conversation that led to the negative verdicts.

** Example result JSON: **
{{
    "reason": "The score is <completeness_score> because <your_reason>."
