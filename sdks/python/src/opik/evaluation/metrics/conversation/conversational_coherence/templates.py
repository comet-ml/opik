def evaluate_conversation(sliding_window: conversation_types.Conversation) -> str:
    return f"""Based on the given list of message exchanges between a user and an LLM, generate a JSON object to indicate whether the LAST `assistant` message is relevant to context in messages.

** Guidelines: **
- Make sure to only return in JSON format.
- The JSON must have only 2 fields: 'verdict' and 'reason'.
- The 'verdict' key should STRICTLY be either 'yes' or 'no', which states whether the last `assistant` message is relevant according to the context in messages.
- Provide a 'reason' ONLY if the answer is 'no'.
- You DON'T have to provide a reason if the answer is 'yes'.
- You MUST USE the previous messages (if any) provided in the list of messages to make an informed judgement on relevancy.
- You MUST ONLY provide a verdict for the LAST message on the list but MUST USE context from the previous messages.
- ONLY provide a 'no' answer if the LLM response is COMPLETELY irrelevant to the user's input message.
- Vague LLM responses to vague inputs, such as greetings DOES NOT count as irrelevancies!
- You should mention LLM response instead of `assistant`, and User instead of `user`.

def generate_reason(score: float, irrelevancies: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> str:
    return f"""Below is a list of irrelevancies drawn from some messages in a conversation, which you have minimal knowledge of. It is a list of strings explaining why the 'assistant' messages are irrelevant to the 'user' messages.
Given the relevancy score, which is a 0-1 score indicating how relevant the OVERALL AI 'assistant' messages are in a conversation (higher values is the better relevancy).

** Guidelines: **
- Make sure to only return in JSON format, with the 'reason' key providing the reason.
- Always quote WHICH MESSAGE and the INFORMATION in the reason in your final reason.
- Be confident in your reasoning, as if youâ€™re aware of the `assistant` messages from the messages in a conversation that led to the irrelevancies.
- You should CONCISELY summarize the irrelevancies to justify the score.
- You should NOT mention irrelevancy in your reason, and make the reason sound convincing.
- You should mention LLM response instead of `assistant`, and User instead of `user`.
- You should format <relevancy_score> to use 1 decimal place in the reason.
