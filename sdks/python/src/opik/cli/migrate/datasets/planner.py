    Ordering invariant (OPIK-7162): the source keeps its original name for

    (``<name>__migrating``) and only promoted to the original name once the
    copy is proven complete. The two closing renames are ordered
    source-away-then-destination-in so the workspace-unique-name constraint
    never trips and — critically — a failure at any earlier step leaves the
    source name untouched and only a discardable temp behind.

    When ``resume_checkpoint`` has ``dataset_phase_done`` set (OPIK-7168), the
    create-temp/replay/optimizations phases already completed on a prior run,

    ``RenameSource`` → ``PromoteDestination``). Replay is omitted — re-running
    it would duplicate every destination version — and its remaps are rebuilt
    read-only from the temp destination via ``reconstruct_remaps``.

    ``from_project`` is an optional source-scope hint (perf + clearer
    error message); ``None`` does a workspace-wide source lookup.

    ``exclude_experiments`` (OPIK-7161) drops the experiment stage. An
    Optimization is a container defined by its constituent experiments, so
    skipping experiments also skips the optimization cascade — otherwise the
    destination would carry empty optimization shells FK-ing experiments that
    were never migrated. The dataset + full version history still migrate.

    The plan emits, in order:

      0. ``DiscardStaleTemp`` — only when a temp destination from a prior
         failed run already exists; deletes it so the re-run starts clean
         (discard-and-restart; safe idempotent re-run).
      1. ``CreateDestination`` — creates the target under the *temp* name.
      2. ``ReplayVersions`` — replays every source version onto the temp
         destination, populating ``plan.version_remap`` /
         ``plan.item_id_remap``.
      3. ``CascadeOptimizations`` — recreates every optimization referencing
         the source dataset under the destination project, populating
         ``plan.optimization_id_remap``. Omitted when
         ``exclude_experiments`` is set.
      4. ``CascadeExperiments`` — recreates every experiment referencing the
         source dataset (traces + spans ride along), re-pointing each
         ``optimization_id`` via ``plan.optimization_id_remap``. Omitted when
         ``exclude_experiments`` is set.
      5. ``RenameSource`` — moves the source to ``<name>_v1``, freeing the
         original name. Runs only after the copy fully succeeds.
      6. ``PromoteDestination`` — renames the temp destination to the
