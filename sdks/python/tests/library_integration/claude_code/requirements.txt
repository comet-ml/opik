# Claude Code SDK requirements for testing
# Note: This file contains the dependencies needed to test the Claude Code integration
# Users will need to install claude-code-sdk separately

# For testing purposes, we use mock objects, so no external dependencies are required
# When the actual Claude Code SDK is available, add it here:
# claude-code-sdk>=0.1.0
