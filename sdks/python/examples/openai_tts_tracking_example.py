OpenAI TTS Tracking Example

This example demonstrates how to use Opik to track OpenAI Text-to-Speech (TTS) calls,
including character-based usage tracking and cost estimation.

Requirements:
- OpenAI API key set as OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- Opik configured (set OPIK_URL_OVERRIDE if using local instance)
